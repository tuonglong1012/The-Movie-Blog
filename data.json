      "During their decade-long quest to defeat the Demon King, the members of the hero's party—Himmel himself, the priest Heiter, the dwarf warrior Eisen, and the elven mage Frieren—forge bonds through adventures and battles, creating unforgettable precious memories for most of them.",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\nHowever, the time that Frieren spends with her comrades is equivalent to merely a fraction of her life, which has lasted over a thousand years. When the party disbands after their victory, Frieren casually returns to her \"usual\" routine of collecting spells across the continent. Due to her different sense of time, she seemingly holds no strong feelings toward the experiences she went through.",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\nAs the years pass, Frieren gradually realizes how her days in the hero's party truly impacted her. Witnessing the deaths of two of her former companions, Frieren begins to regret having taken their presence for granted; she vows to better understand humans and create real personal connections. Although the story of that once memorable journey has long ended, a new tale is about to begin.",

No obnoxiously screaming kid protags, no overly ecchi scenes meant purely for fanservice, no moments where I have to groan and just deal with whatever stupidity is put before me-- Just a fun and emotional journey that is pure story and human feelings.",

We join her at the end, celebrating the accomplishments of her and the party she traveled with. Time passing ever so swiftly as her party aged while she does not as an elf. She's always known that she will easily outage everyone surrounding her and did not think twice of how she spent her time in those many years till next they met. And then she had to come to face with reality-- The hero she'd traveled with would die. Her compatriots would surely soon follow. Uncaring as she was before, she now realizes just how much she should have bothered to care.",

            "\r\nWhat anyone may appreciate most will go into just how well these characters are written. Especially the women! Rarely have I seen a well written woman character that I could fall in love with... and I had just about given up hope in such a male protagonist dominated field. You'll come to appreciate that they're their own characters, with their own thoughts and emotions, with varying personalities and things that get to them in a very human way. Sometimes our emotions don't make sense and occasionally you'll see these characters on their bad days, acting out of sorts and it's interesting to see.",

When the going gets tough and the fights begin, the battle choreography is just so gorgeous to watch. So much detail and weight goes into everyone's movement. I think my only possible gripe could be that sometimes the characters can come off as a little stiff, their faces of emotion not as exaggerated when it comes to anime standards. Maybe that's a good thing and we're too accustomed to over the top facial expressions after all this time-- but occasionally, one wonders if it's not just a little too lifeless at times.",

Just don't go into this expecting it to be fast and getting into this for that quick hit of awesome epic moments. This is a slow ride and an enjoyable one as it builds its world and relationships at a relaxing pace."

Concept wise, I find it to be more similar to Fumetsu no Anata E, since it is about a long-lived non-human protagonist learning about mortality and the short live span of humans while traveling around the world and getting some friends and new abilities.

That’s where I dropped that show but from what I understand afterwards the series mutates from a road movie type of drama to a fighting shounen which in turn drops tremendously in visual quality.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nFrieren doesn’t have those issues. To start off, the animation is pretty good for the most part, there are some weak moments in the artwork and backgrounds but they are usually consistent and very good, even if typical for a fantasy series. The lighting and shading as well as the rest of the special effects are very good, except for the offensive spell that some charracters use, I don’t know why but that looks very outdated. The character designs are very simple and even kind of childish, which are not bad but kind of unfitting at first with the melancholic feeling of the show. The motions are very good at every moment, even the most relaxing ones, each character even has their own distinct way of walking, the facial expressions are very varied and well done, and the action scenes tend to use dynamic movement, like Burn the Witch, Majo no Tabitabi, Akudama Drive and some others did in 2020, and Trigun: Stampede did last year. Overall it’s pretty good in that regard, even if it doesn’t compare with Shangri-la Frontier and Kusuriya no Hitorigoto, which were airing at the same time.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe presentation is good, it’s just that the aesthetics are nothing special. Same thing applies to the audio department, the sound effects are really good and impactful and not too loud and not saturated, the voice acting is ok, nothing special. The soundtrack is really fitting, it’s just typical background music for a fantasy show but it’s very well done and at times even absorbing. The ending song and the insert song (to my understanding, used as an ending for an early screening), both by Milet fit the series really well and are quite beautiful on their own, and the lyrics go very well with the anime. The openings are not as good but the second one is better than the first, which although it had good lyrics for the story, it was strangely upbeat for this time of anime, and thus didn’t fit very well. The second one had a little more energy as well, but at least it felt more appropriate for the second half of the series.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nCharacterization is not the strongest aspect of the anime, the main characters have a name with a specific meaning, and their whole characterization is based around that, in anime terms, the two female are basically kuuderes and the male is the typical kind hearted but misunderstood and poorly treated harem lead. No, I’m not saying nor implying this series is a harem, I’m just saying that the characters fit some of those archetypes, and although that makes them easy to remember because of that, they don’t have very elaborate nor complicating personalities for the same reason.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nWhat they do have, however, is backdrop stories good enough to flesh them out instead of just leaving them as dry archetypes, and they more or less serve to explain the way the characters are. More and more background information about them is revealed and they also come to learn more things about the previous important party, as it also does the audience that way.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nPeople really seem to like the possible romantic dynamic between two members of the party, I personally don’t give a shit about that, the boy is kind but treated poorly by the girl for no reason besides “comedy”. I’ve seen the same dynamic in anime from the 90s and 00s and got tired of it. At least she recognizes later on that she was acting like a brat and they become friendlier with one another afterwards, and for some people they seem to be “couple goals” or some shit like that, I don’t really care.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nWhat’s important is that even the basic main cast here is better than the rock turned wolf turned boy from Fumetsu, he couldn’t even talk, he had no personality nor backdrop, and he changed completely after a time skip, thus that doesn’t count as organic character development.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThis anime has time skips as well but they are nowhere near as big, they don’t skip the scenes of characters learning new things, especially for the main one Frieren, who comes to realize, she knew and was closer to her original party than she always thought and she gains a purpose in life by doing what they want her to do after they died at the beginning of the story, and it all happens on screen, not between time skips.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIt’s even related to the themes, despite being one of the most important heroes in history, Frieren never stood out and never truly cared for anyone else, she never had ambition and never understood how brief a human life could be for an elf like her, until she found out when trying to reunite with her old party, that’s when it clicked in and when she notices that she always took that time for granted and regrets not spending more time with them or getting to know them now that there is no going back. The rest of the series she dedicates to fulfill the last wishes of her old party and recall old times in their adventure, thus coming to realize she knew and cared more about them that she ever considered to, while also collecting some more magic here and there.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThat way, the series also has the chance to flesh out the older support cast that dies early on through flashbacks, and I also realized where the main appeal and value of the series might be, as a sort of company of sorts for people who have recently lost someone and regret not spending enough time with them.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSousou no Frieren is not a tearjerker however, the drama is presented more in a melancholic tone than anything else, which is something I appreciate about it, considering that there are so many shows out there filled with emotional manipulation.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe other mains are fine on their own, they also get flashbacks and learn new things and like I said they become closer with each other, it’s just that the focus is clearly on the protagonist, so they come off as simpler and more inferior characters, especially the guy who gets completely sidelined in the second half.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAlso, compared to that other series, Sousou no Frieren is clear about what it is from the very beginning. There is some action here and there and is usually well animated, directed, choreographed and has some tactics here and there, but for the most part it’s a lighthearted road movie type of fantasy adventure where the character we follow through for the whole show is the strongest, thus the stakes are low. She might not be the most powerful in-series, but we only know that thanks to some throwaway lines, we never really get a sense of urgency or that Frieren might lose or struggle against someone. It’s a show meant to relax to and look back at some of your past relationships, with some magical beams thrown around from time to time for flavour.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSome other things I want to praise the writing for is caring about some very specific things that add to characterization and world building despite being such small details. First, since elves are so long-lived, they get easily emotionally detached from everyone else, they don’t have strong feelings for anyone, neither romantic nor sexual, and that’s why there are few of them and why the protagonist herself is so cold at first. It also helps to explain why, despite being one of the most well-known heroes in history, no one seems to recognize her at first, like Luffy in One Piece, but here is far more believable because the setting doesn’t have the same technology and the main character herself does as much as she can to keep a low profile.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAnother good detail is the explaining for why there isn’t any transportation magic and for why flying magic is limited, which also forces the main cast to actually travel through the fucking setting, whereas other series have several ways for the main cast to be where they need to be when the plot requires them to. This also helps in making the anime feel like, well, an adventure, because how can you have a proper adventure if there is no adventuring, no travelling, no exploring the setting? It’s not like Sousou no Frieren has a world that needs much building nor explaining, it’s a very typical fantasy setting with typical classes, creatures and archetypes, but at least is properly written and established, and it is actually explored, while it also doesn’t function like an RPG, how many other modern fantasy anime can claim the same, eh?",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThat’s why the characters can’t just go wherever they want and in any ways they would like, every city and every place has its rules, and since Frieren herself knows the route well, you get a bit of lore or history from them, having the rest of the party going on their first adventure also helps, since that way the author has a reason for all the explaining to be done, the exposition is excused.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nNot to say that this anime is perfect of course, since there is no clear reasoning why, despite magic evolving so much for being studied for decades and even centuries, basic spells still work the best against newer, supposedly better instructed mages, or why the only mages that know how to control and repress mana in-series are the ones related in some way to the main character.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThen, the whole thing about Frieren kind of falls apart when you consider, “wait, wasn’t her teacher a human? Doesn’t that go against her whole character arc and the main theme of the show?” And the answer from me is yes, I have no excuse for that, and consider it a big flaw in the writing.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nLikewise, the second half of the show is inferior than the first, exactly because it falls for the same issues as the series I compared it to. It is a tournament/exam arc that you would find in an action shounen instead of this one, it completely sidelines an important character, and although needed for the characters to keep going, the plot stops progressing completely for a lot of episodes instead of the mini adventures from earlier, and there are a lot of unimportant secondary characters getting a lot of rushed focus.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nOther series do that as well (Dragon Ball, Hunter x Hunter, Naruto, Yu Yu Hakusho) but being long fighting shounen, their characters don’t disappear completely from the story until way later. I’m an anime only here, thus I can’t tell if someone from the second cour is coming back at some point or not, but I hardly doubt it and I’m sure they don’t join the main party, essentially meaning that for at least this first season, they work against the plot by killing time and taking screentime for no reason.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nWith that said, it’s not straight up bad, since there are still moments to flesh out the two main girls and see them interacting, and there is still some cool action from time to time.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAnd also, well, there is hardly any plot in here, it’s just low on action and stakes basic traveling and adventuring with an overpowered protagonist that goofs around before solving most things thanks to how powerful or experienced she is, and although I like that she is kind of like Maomao from Kusuriya no Hitorigoto, neither an idealistic hot headed idiot typical shounen protagonist, nor an asshole that doesn’t give a shit about people like Elaina from Majo no Tabitabi, she still doesn’t actually do or not most things on her own wish, that’s why she says things like “Himmel would scold me if I did that” or “Himmel would praise me if I do this”.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThus, despite part of me respecting the value and appeal it might have for some emotional people and for how mostly well established the writing and presentation are, the cynical bastard I am only finds boredom in here, because there isn’t much plot, the characters are simple, the stakes are low because the protagonist is overpowered, the plot devices are not the type of which I’m usually thrilled about, the setting is basic, the energy is low, the aesthetics are simple, and the second half, although it still fleshes out two of the main characters, is inferior than the first by falling for the usual meh writing of other shows. In the end I consider it a decent relaxing time passer that can be very appealing for some viewers, but nowhere near as good as the general consensus says it is, and a complete chore to watch for part of the audience, myself included. At least I can say that this anime doesn’t have recaps neither inside nor outside the episode count, which is more than I can say about the other shows I was following at the same time."

            "\r\n",
            "\r\nWorld Building- ",
            "\r\nI've seen so many people praising the \"amazing world building\" this anime has, but I don't understand where they are getting this from. ",
            "\r\nThe actual locations they go to feel like they have little to no importance in the actual world. They just feel like random kingdoms and villages, but why are these kingdoms actually important in the world? We are never really told, so it kind of just feels like they are just there to give the characters a place to go. it makes the world feel less alive and less dynamic. The world isn't changing around our characters, but rather they are changing around the world. It makes watching them journey around random areas feel meaningless. I never once during this anime thought to myself about where the characters would go next, nor did any area feel distinct from each other. There was nothing differentiating the different areas culturally and it just made the anime really boring and feel not alive. There was never a single character we met in one of these areas that wasn't also forgettable. ",
            "\r\n  The world we are in is also so incredibly stereotypical. The fantasy elements aren't creative in any way and they just feel like copies of the same blueprint that fantasy stories have been using for a long time. Even Konosuba was parodying these stereotypes over 10 years ago but yet we are seeing them even more now for some reason. Regardless, Frieren does nothing interesting with these elements. The magic system is generic, the Demons are just bad guys who want to kill people, the kingdoms and villages are all generic, and I can go on and on. It just felt like this anime had a checklist of fantasy setting elements to include, but didn't bother to do anything interesting with any of them. The magic system is poorly implemented as well. Why doesn't pretty much everyone in the world use magic? It's such an advanced tool that I feel like everyone even people doing basic jobs should use it to make their jobs more efficient. It isn't a very well thought out concept and it goes back to what I was saying earlier about how they just included it because that's the norm for fantasy stories. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAnimation/Art/Directing/Soundtrack",
            "\r\nThis is the strongest part of the whole anime. The animation was insane sometimes and there were lots of pretty colors that I actually liked looking at. Animation is such a non factor though this barely added anything to the experience for me. This is probably the least important category when it comes to making a good anime. As far as the art goes, I thought the background scenery was overly generic a lot of the time. Once again, it felt like I couldn't separate it from anything else. It didn't feel very atmospherically alive, but if it did I think I would've liked it a lot more. If this anime was more like Mushishi for example where each scene is just breathing life, I would've appreciated it so much more. In Mushishi there is always so much going on in the background and environmentally, even when nothing is happening it creates such a nice watching environment, that I am just completely entranced. It feels like this is what this anime wanted to be, but failed miserably. The lack of an interesting soundtrack also plays a heavy role in this. There were times where it actually felt like the soundtrack was AI generated.",
            "\r\nThe directing was very boring and there were a lot of annoying flashbacks that happened in the middle of a fight. Sometimes I literally forgot the fight was even happening because of how long the flashbacks were, which is where the problem lies for me. There is nothing wrong with the flashbacks inherently, but they were just very annoying and uninterestingly implemented. There were some scenes where a monster or demon would die, and for some reason they would randomly dissolve as if it was a video game or something. And there is also an annoying amount of explosions in this anime. To the point where explosions pretty much mean nothing since there is one every 3 minutes on average. Even when nothing happens to cause an explosion, one will just randomly happen anyways. ",
            "\r\nThere were a lot of questionable sound design choices surrounding the comedy scenes that took me out of whatever immersion I possibly had left. They would use silly sound effects that didn't fit in the actual world and it felt really off putting. However, as for my first positive in this whole review, I actually really love the crystally sound effect they use whenever a character uses magic. It actually sounded really cool and it was probably my favorite part of the whole anime.  ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nComedy- ",
            "\r\nThis anime does a poor job at mixing in its comedy with seriousness. There is one episode where Stark is bitten by a venomous snake and he was on the edge of potentially dying. Yet, the characters were being very unserious about it, as if it didn't even matter. There were many instances of this during the anime and it just got unwatchable. How am I supposed to take this anime seriously when even the people making it aren't taking it seriously. ",
            "\r\nBesides that a lot of the comedy feels like it was written by a 13 year old. The jokes just felt very forced in, and it often repeats jokes a lot as if us hearing about the drunk priest again for the 50th time was gonna be any more funny than the 49th time. A lot of the characters are purely used as comedy sticks and don't even feel like their own person. Pretty much the entire cast of Frierens old group are 1 dimensional comedy characters that got carried by Frieren to defeating the demon king. The priest is drunk every time we see him in a flashback, himmel is always acting like an idiot which is supposed to be funny because he's actually supposed to be like a hero or something, but he actually is just a goofball (its funny and stark is totally not the same character), and the beard guy never talks and is pretty much just afk. Oh and if one drunk priest wasn't enough, we get a second one midway through the anime. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nCharacters- ",
            "\r\nNone of the characters feel like humans. They are constantly expressionless, especially during fights, and it just makes them very unrelatable. The way they talk is robotic as well. It's annoying that our main 2 characters are the most expressionless in the whole anime, and of course they get the most screen time. I already talked about the other characters from Frierens flashbacks, and that applies here too. Most of the characters are either expressionless robots, or purely comedy characters. There are very few actually serious characters and when I say very few I mean only 2. There is no character development, and everyone stays the same as they were before. After Stark defeats the dragon on his own early on, he doesn't grow as a character, he just stays as an annoying whiny brat. Fern is always mad at stark, even when their relationship progresses, it always goes back to square 1 and nothing ever happens to progress anything really. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nPlot- ",
            "\r\nBoring, nothing happens between episodes 10-18. There isn't really much to talk about because there isn't really much plot to begin with. Frieren is kind of just looking after Fern because the drunk priest wanted to and they just wander around together. That's pretty much it. I guess they have an objective to go up to the north so they spend 18 episodes doing nothing, and then doing an exam so that they can try becoming tier 1 mages to go up north. It's very boring and nothing happened this entire season. This anime is more about its themes than its plot but I think the themes aren't explored very well. I did resonate with them a lot early on, but the same themes of nostalgia and time perception got really repetitive and they never really went anywhere. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIn conclusion, this anime is not good in any way and honestly I gave it the most positive rating I could've possibly given it. I was bored from start to finish, and there was very little redeeming qualities in this anime. The only reason I didn't rate this anime lower is because  I think there are much worse anime out there and in comparison to those, I guess this one isn't the worst thing ever, but it probably deserves a 2 or a 3 in reality. This anime is full of plot conveniences and nonsense. If you would like to see more of what I thought about this anime, feel free to check out the youtube channel in my bio. I uploaded a full length review on this anime where I talk about a lot of the things I wrote here, as well as a lot of other things I didn't go into depth about."

With each passing episode I feel more and more disappointed that both MaoMao and Jinshi's character development have fallen to the wayside and completely stagnated. So far it has been a lot more about solving mysteries halfway, and then MaoMao bailing on those situations when they get more complicated. There are 12 more episodes ahead, so a lot can still change, but so far this season has left me a bit disappointed."

The movies themselves are just very cinematic, having the same director as Bakemono it makes sense, but the style is just right up my alley. The fight scenes in\n                  ",

That, combined with the blatant CGI gives everything a really clunky and bizarre feel, especially the fights, which also were pretty bad. The fights all felt very random, each in their own way.

For example, the final fight of the series. What were they even going for? Comedy? Action? Suspense? An emotional moment? Shock factor? As the fight progresses, each of these themes is presented at random points for seemingly no reason. While it is possible to balance comedy and action, or shock factor and suspense, etc, this fight does not even come close to it. It was a mess of emotions and themes that ultimately provided for a ridiculous fight without so much as a satisfying end. Speaking of which, the end was also terrible. It's almost like they wrote season 1 before the prequel movies and had to come up with a reason for why Araragi was part-vampire. Oh wait, that's exactly what they did. They act like they provided a happy ending to the arc, but really if you look past what they're trying to force on you it's very obvious that the ending is a lot more depressing than it seems. Not only is it depressing, it's also very uncharacteristic of Araragi, which is probably because the writers didn't realize how messed up the ending actually is. Finally, Hanekawa. They pretty much changed her from a collected, mild-mannered girl into an overly-flirtatious and outgoing character...for some fanservice scenes? In the first season, it becomes known that Hanekawa has a crush on Araragi. Initially, one would be surprised, because Hanekawa shows 0 romantic/sexual interest in Araragi. But after watching five minutes of the first movie, you could tell immediately. ",

As Einar and Thorfinn work together toward their freedom, they are haunted by both sins of the past and the ploys of the present.

It’s a sequel that doesn’t just follow—it rewrites the rules, hitting you with a slow-burn power that tops any war cry.

It lingers, letting every regret sink in as he asks: what’s life worth when all you’ve done is kill? Einar’s his fire—rough, real, unshakable—dragging Thorfinn toward something better. Canute’s the other side: a king forging peace through iron will, his every move a calculated step away from Thorfinn’s quiet fight. They’re opposites—mercy versus might—and it’s gripping. Thorfinn even brushes against Christian teachings here, a nudge toward mercy that’s real, not preachy—fitting for a Viking world steeped in pagan roots, though his heart stays murky, more searching than saved.",

His flashbacks—harsh, red-streaked shots of Askeladd’s grin—slash through the gloom. Canute’s world is different: crisp, icy, his polished halls and steely glares a total flip from Thorfinn’s mud.

Shizuka Ishigami’s Thorfinn is unreal—every cracked line and silent beat is award-level brilliance. Kensho Ono’s Canute is sharp and cool, a king’s voice that chills you.

Canute builds peace on bones, a dark echo to Thorfinn’s light. I expected battles; I got a flawless, soul-shaking look at living beyond your past. This is a 10/10—a story that carves itself into you and says: survival’s nothing without meaning."

Additionally, the characters aren’t even endearing or interesting in any sort of way because they’re barely indistinguishable from each other.

Plot conveniences are practically everywhere, so, without delving into spoilers, the generic male main character (not even gonna try with this one) is written to coincidentally forget certain past events, and whether they’re important or vital for the plot plays out conveniently. Additionally, the second \"plot twist\" (yes, there's two) relies on the [generic male protagonist] being functionally illiterate since it relies on something that needs him to read to realize, which reinforces the grating nature of his inability to remember things. Given that he is written to be not so bright, he is somehow able to remember one of the special places he's been with the [generic female protagonist], which then makes him remember one specific clothing piece that belongs to her.

The main issue with the characters is that they aren’t realistic and the “emotional connection” between the two is extremely forced. This can be noted by the characters’ lack of chemistry with each other. I mean, the [generic male protagonist] had already developed feelings for his coworker. Surprisingly, the story handles this in the most hilarious way possible (funnier than all of the other “comedic” moments of the series), because the [generic female protagonist] helps set up a date between the two. This would only make sense if she has a weird cuckoldry fetish or something, but even then, she needs to firstly convince him to indulge in the same depraved fetishes she does. In addition to this, writing can be seen as being incredibly corny. Barely any of the dialogue spoken by the two felt natural and grounded in reality. For example, the [generic female protagonist], after helping the the [generic male protagonist] with a girl, texts to herself “it’s all thanks to my feminine side,” or whatever. Firstly, the [generic male protagonist] is already a spineless pussy indistinguishable from his female counterpart, and secondly, no real human writes like that. Writing down a mental note that only goes as far as congratulating oneself for aligning themselves with a trait stereotypical of their kin seems purposeless. Additionally, a lot of the astrological bullshit also ties into both of the characters needing to save the day together and stuff, as if the movie couldn’t be any more of a purposeless mess.",

To top it off, the only explanation this series offers is utter nonsense. I felt absolutely nothing from start to finish, I was just immensely bored.",

No complaints whatsoever about any of the performances. The animation was the usual golden standard from Kyoto Animation - breathtaking at parts, and exactly what we've come to expect over the years. The soundtrack is no slouch, either.

The last 20 minutes of the film were extremely underwhelming for me, try as the film did to make me emotionally satisfied with the conclusion to Violet's story. Now I can't go into the details without spoilers, but suffice it to say that, speaking for myself, I saw it as a disappointing end to Violet's character arc. Not only was it wholly predictable, leaning on some of the most cliche tropes used in media, but it also (in my personal opinion) betrayed a lot of the character development and buildup for Violet throughout the anime series. I found myself thinking, \"oh god, they're not going in that direction, are they?\" right before the climax of the film, but lo and behold, they went in that direction.",

Throughout her encounters across the land writing letters for various clients, each with their own story arc, and interacting with the supporting cast at her workplace, Violets learns to think for herself, to act on her own desires, and, slowly but surely, understand what it means to feel \"love.\"",

Forgive me if I sound harsh, but I think I've spend way too much time with Violet on her journey, looking on as if I was growing and maturing with an old friend, to simply be given an \"and they lived happily ever after\" ending, with no strings attached, complete with the \"dash to the port/airport\" cliche and the \"jump off the boat to rush to shore and embrace lover\" cliche.",

The ending just becomes a more emotionally unsatisfying mess the more I think about it. It's as if the director/writer said, \"Look, I know Violet has matured a lot over the years, but she needs a happily-ever-after ending with Gilbert no matter what happened in between. That's what the audiences want and expect, so that's what we'll give them. Oh, and let's throw in a scene of Violet bawling her eyes out while hugging Gilbert in there so the audience will feel happy for her.\"",

It's that last part where this film then proceeds on a downward spiral that in my opinion conflicts with everything KyoAni had set up with Violet up till this point. The writers of the show initially made a crucial change from it's respective source material, one that objectively did a much better job at establishing Violet as an independent character who had to face her own struggles separated from the only person she ever cared for.",

She had created a life for herself, one that Gilbert would have been happy for her. She'd changed and shaped so many lives around her, from friends to enemies, playwrights and singers, daughters, sisters, and even old commanders. Along the way, she even came to understand what it meant to love, how to cherish it, how to express that feeling on the behalf of others, as well as the pain and heartbreak it causes. Come the ending however, all of that seems to have been wasted on our heroin and results in one of the most cliché confessions I've ever seen, with a complete 180 for multiple characters development. That's the spoiler free version. ",

Instead though this film decides to go on the very slow burn, and while every frame may be beautiful...it also takes forever to go anywhere....and when we finally do get there, I couldn't help but feel disappointed.

The second plot focusses on sick boy Yurith who Violet writes letters for as his dying wish. The third plot has Violet discovering that Major Gilbert is in fact still alive. To put it bluntly, none of these plots really have much in common with the others, as the first one has no impact on the main characters, the second one is wasted by Violet's final decision, and the last one is only really focussed on in the second half of the film.

The second plot really feels more like a side story, which is strange considering the show has always been about discovering other people's stories and writing letters to convey their feelings. This is not to say that the film certainly doesn't lack emotion and even though I questioned Yurith's purpose in the film, I still couldn't help but tear up at his conclusion. Yet he doesn't get nearly as much development as other side characters we've come across before, and therefor doesn't carry much weight on the story as a whole.",

It feels in every essence like the writers were going back on how they initially set up her character. We see some interesting points, like Gilbert wanting to bury his past in order to protect Violet from the pain she suffered. It's also here however that the film seems most conflicted with the message it's trying to convey, as everything the film sets up for these characters completely and suddenly chances by the end, with very little resolution on top. It's hard to tell if this was what the writers always intended from when they gave us that original open ending in the series but I'd definitely take that conclusion over this one.",

I love the soundtrack for VE, and even here it's hard not to love the subtle notes than blend beautifully with the gorgeous imagery. However there is nothing here that is unique compared to what we've heard before, no typewriter, no resounding scores, it's mostly the same melancholy tone that doesn't really change throughout the film. Everytime a letter was flying through the air, I just kept being reminded of the opening scene in the series and wished the music would catch up, but it never did. I also couldn't help but feel disappointed by the lack of resolution for the show's side characters: Claudia, Benedict, Cattleya, Luculia, and Iris just to name a few. None of them have any memorable moments, and even though we spend a lot of time with Claudia, I couldn't help but feel like the film missed a great opportunity with his character by the end. After all, he was the closest thing Violet had to a carer after Gilbert's departure. ",

If the film had trusted it's audience and been just a bit braver to continue the journey it initially set up, this would have easily been great. It's not the resounding conclusion to Violet's story I was hoping for, but I take comfort in the knowledge that there are many fans who love KyoAni's work and especially love this film. I just wish I could have had that connection with Violet's story one last time."

The story progresses in a rather linear fashion from one fight to another, introducing Ippo's opponents one at a time and moving Ippo himself steadily up the ranks of a young boxer. However, since very little of the show is not about Ippo himself, the routine does become a bit stale quickly. By the second or third fight, it is already apparent what the formula Morikawa George is using consists of. Ippo's next enemy is stronger than his last, and he must somehow adapt to this, typically by learning some new technique. And when the fight itself comes, it all boils down to Ippo winning through his sheer tenacity - no matter what his opponents throw at him, he just doesn't give up, and you just know the spectators will feel the need to comment on his never ending stamina between every single round. In all truth, while simple, this is both tiring and unsatisfying, especially since Ippo's opponents are almost always significantly more interesting and endearing than Ippo himself. ",

These are typically much more convincing arguments for their victory than Ippo's, who is new to the boxing world and is on the losing side of the fight until it eventually comes down to, once again, Ippo simply lasting longer than his opponent despite an overwhelming disadvantage. In particular, I found myself rooting for the Russian boxer Alexander Volg Zangief. The emotional weight of his fights and career was more powerful than anything Ippo ever managed to achieve.",

This shows in two places in the show - a short arc about Ichiro Miyata training in Mexico, and the subplot about Takamura Mamoru earning and defending his title. In both of these the viewer finds more complex characters and detailed, well-thought out fights that capitalize on everything their respective subplots have to offer.

The camera feels loose and free, not restrained by the cheap but easy to animate single angles that usually plague TV anime. The boxers' movements are accentuated by wind effects like they are kicking up dust every time they move, but it is used tastefully so that it only adds to the experience, something that can only be done reasonably in animation. Successful hits look painful, damage to the boxers accumulates as the fights go on. However, outside of fights, the animation becomes par for the course, though still not bad for an early 2000s TV anime. Madhouse pulled off a show that looks ahead of its time.

The thing is that it doesn't.... But it does.... But doesn't. Without spoiling anything, Gintama is a mostly comedic series, only\n                  ",

The plot is actually existent within the series, but we can say it happens \"off screen\", since the main cast is often not involved with it. The author does however throw out certain plot points and foreshadowing here and there, which later turn into an actual plot. Fans will often refer to the series' \"serious arcs\" as the plot, which is valid, since they do tie in with the plot itself. But shortly said: Even though Gintama has almost no plot, watchers still stay for the rest of the content, until the plot actually begins at (surprise, surprise) not episode 1. They way Gintama does it, is brilliant, since even though the plot is to be looked forward to, there is so much else before it that is both appealing and worth watching. Something the plot alone will never justify.",

            "\r\nCharacters:",
            "\r\nThe characters of this series are clearly the strongest points of the series' quality. Not because the rest is bad (look at my rating), but because they are just so well established. I've heard many fans state that \"Gintama's cast will be the most lovable cast of characters you will experience\", and even though many may argue with that, I agree with the statement, since it does make a point. Gintama has a huge cast, with maybe 20+ cast members that you will often see throughout the series, including the three protagonists: Gintoki, Shinpachi and Kagura. Aside from them, you will experience that almost all of the characters will get their own depth and quality, which make them unique and memorable characters. Almost everyone has their own quirks and problems, as well as backstories, experiences and later development. You will often watch them as you laugh at them and with them, as well as cry with them. Each one of them is lovable in their own way, not because you are guaranteed to relate to them, but because how much the author respects and loves them to write them the way they are. I could sit here and ramble on how deep and lovable the main character Gintoki is for instance, and how much his past experiences and present connect to each other to make a good character, but nothing I say any more, can do the characters' quality justice. If you feel like you don't like even one of the characters, then I do not know how to defend myself.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAnimation:",
            "\r\nThis is finally something to complain a little about. The animation in this series has never been particularly good, nor has it ever been horrible. A very episodic series like this has no need for extraordinary or consistently stunning animation like the Fate-series or Violet Evergarden. In comedic and \"calm\" episodes, the animation is not the main point, since it is the comedy and the short-term storytelling that matters. You can say that intense scenes like battles, duels or chases require good animation for better experience, and that is exactly what Gintama has. Whenever a fight or an intense scene occurs, the animation will always step up (a lot) to make the scene great, but you cannot expect all of the 350+ episodes to have animation like that. Why I did not give the animation higher than 8/10, is because it would be to generous, but I do not complain too much either, since I do not require better animation than I need. If this is a problem to you, I will excuse myself, since this paragraph may have been useless in that case.",

            "\r\nOther factors:",
            "\r\nI will try to make my points shorter here, so that the paragraph won't be super long. MUSIC is an important part in a story, but for Gintama, it is not exceptionally good (but not bad at all). The \"beautiful\" soundtracks do not match with for instance Naruto's, and the motivational/intense tracks do not match with One Piece's. However, what Gintama does great, is creating few tracks that are associated with a certain scene or a character. There are a few songs you will hear maybe 2-3 times in the whole series, which you will associate with one powerful scene, which will make a good experience.",
            "\r\nTHE COLLECTION OF GENRES, is also an important factor that makes Gintama, in my opinion fantastic. It is mostly known for being a comedy series (which it excels in of course), but there is much more to it. You will see many other genres or elements from other genres all the time, since it can go from lung-paining comedy, to touching and calm Slice of Life, to (sometimes) deep and emotional romance, bombastic and exciting action and, not least: Tear jerking and painful drama. All these genres get switched between all the time, and it is made in a way that is not absolutely messy or not understandable, but instead very structured and well-made. That is something many pieces of fiction have a hard time with.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nFew Complaints:",
            "\r\nSince Gintama is very episodic, we are bound to enjoy some arcs and episodes more than others. Even though there has never been an episode or arc that I really hated, some episodes end up being a little weaker in both quality and enjoyment. Another complaint is that since the cast is so large, some characters will be a little less developed and more flat. And as said before, as there are characters you will most likely relate to, there are some you will not care about so much, and that is difficult to avoid. But these complaints compared to the rest of the praise do not push the series to a 9/10 for me at all, so the series is still pretty much perfect in my eyes (sorry for being a little biased there).",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nConclusion:",
            "\r\nIf you want to start/continue with Gintama, there are things you must remember. This series requires patience, so do not expect it to become a masterpiece right away, but please know that as you go on, you will be rewarded with better and better stuff along the journey. When you finally reach the end, you may think \"This series was long, but it was absolutely worth the time\". But to be more straight forward, think of it like this: ",
            "\r\nThe first serious/plot heavy arc (around 5 eps long) arrives somewhere between episode 50 and 60, where many watchers learn what Gintama can be and WILL be except just comedy. But if you still hate the show after episode 87, then I do not know how to defend myself lol. You will se more arcs like these of course, especially in the last 50 episodes. One more thing: since most of the comedy is based around parodies and references from other anime, it will be better if the watcher has some experience with anime and manga beforehand. Having watched between 5 and 10 animes is enough, I feel, so the comedy will become better. If this review helped, I greatly recommend this series, as it is the best anime (in quality) I have ever seen. I wish you a happy journey, and I hope you will enjoy this greatness of a series.",

But it all falls apart the moment Sorachi tries to introduce some drama into the plot; the more of it, the more obnoxious it becomes. The characters, all conveniently stuffed together for the occasion, immediately arm themselves with their corniest lines, so cringe-worthy that even the typical Shonen Jump series about a self-unaware spiky-haired underdog would consider them a faux pas. The plot armor surrounding the regular cast dispels all the dramatic tension, because we know for a fact: characters would only die when the author decides they should, circumstances and common sense be damned. Battles are won not with skill and strategy but with sheer determination and (now more often than not) various forms of deus ex machinae. Battle choreography is neither realistic nor aesthetically pleasing. Antagonists are all limp, incredibly conflicted, and would constantly waver between their sociopathic ambitions and attempts at a hamfisted redemption arc meant to trick the audience into thinking better of them. They would often have this sudden change of heart at the end (after a couple dozen flashbacks doing a very poor job at making us care)—only to be immediately killed by somebody even badder right afterwards, or they would proactively sacrifice themselves, succumbing to the injuries that should've killed them many times over by that point. But most importantly, none of them really warrant sympathy—their cause is never relatable nor exciting enough to even consider them important. Even Utsuro owes his status quo to the Joi Four's past history with him: whatever he is doing in the present is blown up to such immense scale that confrontation becomes inevitable, but otherwise it's completely irrelevant and uninteresting. The fact that Utsuro's alter ego was a teacher to Gintoki and the others is the only thing separating him from being a random last-boss bad guy. Frankly, the way Sorachi shoves the drama up your throat is insulting to intelligence.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAnd the worst part is that the series has mostly been focusing on this mess of a drama ever since the Shogun Assassination arc, constantly upping the ante of cringe-worthiness and exercises in literary impotence. One pointless epic battle after another, one entire-cour-spanning flashback after another. This is what anime at its worst looks like. And I'm not saying this to put down the anime production team—god knows they've been doing their darnedest to elevate the material. But they can't fix what is fundamentally wrong with the writing.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThus, despite my affection towards the series as a whole, I won't sugarcoat the truth nor try to delude myself: *Gintama sucks when it stops being funny.* It gets dragged down by bad storytelling, poor pacing, braindead dialogues, stunted characterization, and all sorts of melodramatic emotional manipulation the very moment it takes a break from the jokes. If it hadn't established a deeply invested audience through a long and fruitful history of mostly high-quality comedy, nobody would watch it for the plot—let alone put it on so high a pedestal. Considering that, I resigned myself to see the series through at what I considered its lowest point, because I'd already invested so much in it and wanted to have at least some closure, however poor, along with the other 36,191 hopeless idiots—but what did I get there? In the last 1/3 of the arc the series does a 180° on me and goes back to being a (mostly) light-hearted comedy once again...",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\n...And then, instead of giving me said closure, it kind of reboots itself and just ends midways. Nani the fuck?! I mean, sure, subversion of expectations and all that, but let's be real. No matter how you lampshade it by doing that 4th-wall-breaking commentary at the end, it goes beyond poor planning. And I'm one hundred percent on board with the anime production team: Sorachi (and his editor) should take responsibility for the disaster his series has become. That is, either end it already and provide a worthy payoff for all the stupid drama, or pretend that crap never happened and let it remain the episodic comedy it once was for a while longer (but then still end it before it outstays its welcome). But for the love of all that is holy, don't engage in this ridiculous \"oh, but I want to conclude the story—oh, but I kinda don't want it to end—oh, but I want it to be serious—oh, but I also want more jokes in there\" back-and-forth bullshit. It doesn't work and it leaves more than a few people with quite the bad aftertaste. It's the entertainment industry equivalent of an abusive family member whom you love not *because* they are a wonderful person but *despite* the wretched scum they are—simply because the bonds were formed back when your relationship was more wholesome. And we all (hopefully) know that the biggest mistake one can make when dealing with an abusive person is thinking that it'll go back to being wholesome if we remain patient and forgiving. Don't be stupid; vote with your feet and your wallet—that's the only thing that works against somebody trying to give you shit.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIn summary, if I were fair and were judging this season for the travesty it was, I'd have given it a 4 it just barely deserved. But since I have a lingering affection towards some of the characters, and a lot of the gags in the last 1/3 genuinely made me laugh—and very nearly made it worth slogging through the first 2/3—I thought I'd bump it up a little. But make no mistake, this is nowhere near Gintama's finest, and I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch up until this point. Gintama° was fine, Porori-hen was a good break, but do yourself a favor and leave it all at that. The whole Utsuro thing isn't worth the time."

The banter on the other hand is almost as hideous as seen in the movie Deadpool 2, but thank God not as meta. The comedy is so bad and badly timed that even during the more serious and decent moments, it comes there and completely ruins everything the series accomplishes by inserting some dude there who farts or does something equally lame.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe characters are something that could be decent -- to be frank, if the characters were a separate entity, they could all be said to be of respectable quality -- but the author practically never uses their personalities for their benefit. Almost every single reaction they show is ridiculously, even absurdly overreacted because the author doesn't trust that his characters' personalities alone could carry the content and the jokes he presents. The work is filled with moments where characters just yell some nonsense to each others because apparently, acting like overdramatic clowns is much better than actually creating comedy based to their characteristics. The sentence \"it's so damn anime\" is pretty much the perfect way to describe how Gintama's cast works. The only character who gets dealt with the respect they deserve, is Zura, and that's not enough. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe art is very clever. At least if we consider edgy 10 year old kids who are vandalizing the town by drawing pictures of genitals on every damn thing they see, clever. When it comes to Gintama, I don't think I have ever seen anyone put so much effort into making every goddamn background object resemble the shape of a penis. Perhaps my favorite part of the art is how often it focuses on puking and blood and assholes and dicks, yet every time these are censored and pixelated so its readers/viewers won't form a trauma because let's face it, most of them are also like 10 years old. It's beyond me how the main content is penis, farts and in generally, dirty jokes, yet they are presented pseudo and aimed for little kids. At least series like South Park went all out with their content and remained loyal to the idea to the very end. Gintama is just censorship aimed for people whose sense of humor was formed in elementary school toilets but never developed it more mature and over the top direction. Gintama is like a person who ages, but never grows up or matures.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAs a conclusion: I laughed something like ~50 times during the entire run. Gintama is not a good series. It's characters are pretty much always used as comedy elements, the jokes get old in 50 episodes (starting from 80 because the first 80 don't even have any jokes), the writing is often ruined by stupid \"gags\" to a point that the good things become less good. Every cringe and downright awful piece of writing is justified by it being a parody. \"So you're denying all the good things the show accomplished.\" Not really, I am just saying that even the worst of things have good sides in them and just like that, I won't be praising Gintama for its achievements."

It turns out that the movie pirate wasn't a pirate after all—it was an android time machine, and Gintoki has been hurtled five years into the future! Shinpachi and Kagura, his Yorozuya cohorts, have had a falling out and are now battle-hardened solo vigilantes and he himself has been missing for years, disappearing without a trace after scribbling a strange message in his journal.",

Is that all this Movie Thief is though? Is he just there to film illegally? Or maybe his role is more significant than we may think.

Though, as we all know, time-travel is a commonly seen thing in shows and that of movies. Some could say that the movie is pretty predictable, but that's for you to decide; I didn't think it was.",

Character designs as I've talked a little about have been changed for a few as well. Shinsengumi is no longer the police force anymore really, but almost something like the Joui rebels themselves, though not necessarily identical. The producers decided to poke at some of the characters too, by making fun of them; Catherine mainly, who prioritizes in mainly making the viewer's think of her as the troll character of Gintama.

Everyone who has watched the T.V series knows that all we've seen about Gin's past was little flashbacks during the war. So shouldn't we be seeing more of the war? Well no, if they did that the film would be shorter than a 3 episode long series. This was the best way to do things IMO, and the producers did it pretty damn good. Overall, the film gives tons of laughs throughout it, but kind of lacked in the action packed scenes. Though one could argue that Gintama isn't your typical shounen and that action isn't everything, which is correct because Gintama does what it does best and that is making you laugh."

If you've seen one anime about time traveling, whether it be Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya or Steins;Gate, you've seen them all. What these stories have in common is using time-travel as a plot-device to provoke a sense of regret and gratefulness out of our otherwise complacent main characters. This concept strings pretty far back in the medium and unless the story is presented in an innovative manner the plot device of time travel is incredibly predictable. Time travel can no longer exist as the sole concept in a work. In Steins;Gate it was a character study on the stress of an individual undergoing intense trauma, and in Disappearance it was the deliberation between being safe or being  in love. In both stories the main characters support the work. Here time travel is sadly used as a way to advance a very generic story in a setting that was created to provide the Gintama fanbase with some fun character designs.",

But we don't get to see the characters from the main series develop into their new character designs, we just see how they've changed in five years. It's a bit disappointing coming from a series that often pays meticulous care to even the most trivial character's background. For a movie marketed as game-changing for the franchise, I can't help but to feel a little swindled. It's mostly just the same Gintama jokes from the show with less attention to story.",

While the movie is presented as a mystery Gin does almost none of the footwork to figure out about the world around him or how to fix it. The events of the movie occur jarringly fast. Plot points simply keep forcing themselves into scenes until finally you arrive at the final battle. It's frustrating that the film is so linear and there is almost no despair to be felt in a world that was supposedly ravaged. Even as far as a Gintama arc would go, it is safe to say that this would be a very weak one. The story suffers from cliches, linearity, and unbelievable explanations to the point of boredom. The main Gintama series can do better than this story and it's upsetting to see such little thought put into it.",

The animation looks vastly improved from the main series, though! Simply put, it is more fluid and provides a greater range of facial expression. The fight scenes are also animated very well, and provide for some exciting hack-and-slash entertainment. The character designs are great and should be lauded as well. The movie does a great job poking fun at some characters with the astute redesigns and pays attention to detail here with wardrobe subtleties. A fun example is Shinpachi is wearing Gin's shirt and Kagura is wearing his robe as a skirt. If there's an reason to see this movie it's to see the older counterparts of each character.",

Some of the jokes are really funny, but mostly the films struggles with a convincing plot and frequently devolves into artificial sentimentality. I liked the film but was disappointed in it's simplistic design, but I humbly hope Gintama returns to form with some more hotpot and Christmas episodes in April."

The anime is set in imperial China and tells the story of Maomao, who was kidnapped and taken to the emperor's palace. From there, we begin to learn more about her personality and traits, along with the unfolding of the story, revealing an intricate web of interconnected events and mysteries.",

It's literally a butterfly effect, where a small event can lead to something big or be intrinsically linked to something that has already happened! As for the narrative, it has many comedic elements while also being serious when needed, although it may seem somewhat unpretentious in some episodes!",

The backgrounds were also very good, although they did not reach the level of detail found in films like \"Kimi no Na wa\". The only downside was the CGI, which stood out a bit from the rest of the animation and caused some unease.",

Her romantic partner is also a captivating and enjoyable character, and the interactions between the two are very pleasant! As for the personal development of each character, in this aspect, the anime does not deliver as much. You can sympathize with the characters and feel some of what they feel, but the work does not usually delve deeply into their feelings, leaving it up to the viewer to interpret what they feel or think and the reasons for it! This is cool for an anime that focuses on mystery! Just don't expect major dramatic developments of the characters with the anime delving into their thoughts, emotions, and motivations very clearly!",

The rhythm and execution were done with great care, making the anime truly deserve many points for it. Even in episodes where there were no major revelations, the anime maintained good quality using other elements like comedy, having excellent comedic timing in these scenes, and a great power to generate memes with Maomao's facial expressions and reactions. The series manages to grip you, captivate you, and leave you interested in the story, making you feel part of it!",

Nothing absurd like Sawano or Masaru Yokoyama level, but the soundtrack is good, although I don't believe it to be an extremely outstanding point in the work. There are some scenes with cool tracks that deserve to be seen with affection, but they are not emblematic and striking. In this aspect, I've seen works that had a greater capacity to be striking. Another point in this topic would be to highlight the Openings and Endings, which are excellent songs, especially the first Opening and the first Ending. They are truly songs to listen to on repeat for a long time!",

Just don't expect a series where absolutely all mysteries are interconnected and all subplots are relevant to the main plot, that said.. I highly recommend it and I'm looking forward to a future continuation."

Maomao being a detective might be fine, her scientific interest aligns with critical thinking, but the fact that she actually guesses correctly every single thing thrown at her can make her look too perfect at a job she doesn’t actually have. She also teaches concubines about how to be better at having sex, despite being a virgin, and this is a problem, as she is better than other people in their areas of expertise when she is supposed to just be an apothecary, and that extends to things beyond this point.

She is very quirky and shows no interest in men, but that’s what gets her Jinshi being interested in her, since unlike the other girls who are lusting over Jinshi everywhere he goes, she is not interested in him as she is not like the other girls and her quirkiness makes her “interesting”, so she ends up getting attention from the perfect guy despite the fact that he doesn’t receive any reciprocation from her. I thought that we made fun of this when a romcom is about a 10/10 girl talking to the completely average guy just because he is nice, why is this suddenly okay when the exact thing is being done here?",

            "\n        Owarimonogatari season 2 is the conclusion, final chapter, to the main storyline presented since Bakemonogatari in 2009. And to say that it was a long time coming would be an understatement. It has been nearly a decade since I fell in love with this anime. While it has had its ups and downs it never became intolerable. For anyone who kept watching this series for this long or joined the train, enjoy the finale. ",

            "\r\nMayoi Hell consists of Ararargi going to hell after being intentionally killed by Gaen. If you haven't watched Koyominonogatari by now you should go back because it is very necessary. As well as obviously watching the rest of the series that has aired beforehand. Visually it is an extremely fun episode and seeing Ararargi and Mayoi banter after all these years is great. We saw them send each other off in the Second Season in a touching moment and in the Final Season, we see the wonderful reunion. The music that accompanies the touching moment towards the end pulls at your heartstrings. Can you call it manipulative? Sure but it sure has hell worked well. The comedic timing can be abrasive and I say this in a positive way. It's an onslaught of comedy smacking in your face with animation shifting from cartoony back to on model. With sprinkles of deep dialogue, we get a traditional Monogatari script. The most important element of the arc is Ararargi showing his attitude towards life changing but his heart remains the same. He will always want to save people even if he went back and did things again. However, he still shows some regret in the approach he took and how he could have improved on it. Anyone who has been interested in Ararararararagi's character development will be satisfied seeing him converse with Mayoi. In the second half of the arc, we are met with a character that was first introduced in Tsukimonogatari. To not get spoilers they converse about why Ararargi had to die and come back to life. This arc truly benefitted from the TV Special format because they were a ton of different settings being presented as Mayoi and Ararargi take a journey to meet the man who will bring him back to life. The animation quality was astonishing far better than what we saw in Owarimonogatari season 1. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nHitagi Rendevouz isn't just a filler date between our main cast and heroine. While Hitagi takes a large chunk of her self-proclaimed arc, Ougi Oshino interrupts to speak about the important implications that were presented in Mayoi Hell. Ougi's near threatening dialogue and the sound design gives me chills down my spine when hearing her speak to Ararargi. Without having any knowledge of the next arc, Ougi Dark, you feel anxiety throughout. But wait wait wait let's get back to the date between our main girl and main boy. Hitagi probably looks the most beautiful here than in any other series. While this is obviously a personal feeling I had to put it in the ethersphere. But being beautiful isn't just about the character design, shaft really kept up with the animation and kept her on model almost throughout. With the obvious exception of comedic animation shifts. The backgrounds are rich and full of life as Hitagi, with her new driving license, takes out Ararargi on a date. The date itself was very charming. The most befitting to a 6 months relationship. To the viewers, it has been 8 years. ",

Well, by doing that I wrote something which although it isn’t entirely inaccurate, it also omits how the two characters were more fleshed out during that particular series. ",

Whatever it covers brings a proper closure of the past of the main cast just fine.”",

            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe first arc shows the chronological first apparition of Ougi, sometime before the Nadeko arc of Second Season, and as soon as (she?) appears (she?) messes with Koyomi, making him face the past that he kept avoiding in what was written with the intention to represent suppression of painful memories, yet unfortunately at times felt more like the main character having an extremely bad memory for the sake of the plot.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nDespite that, fleshing him out beyond his comical and archetypical role of a harem lead is definitely a good move and something that he really needed. It explains how he became a bleak and antisocial loner, which complements well with his development of that phase in Kizumonogatari into his personality of the rest of the franchise. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nI mean, his backdrop story comes down to a kid that can’t accept that reality is not what he pictured it to be, so his actions come off as somewhat petty, but reminding myself that his whole world view more or less crumbled when he was very young and naïve definitely helped in making everything more acceptable. Showing this after the character already developed in the future events shown on the previous seasons or the exact next entries was also a good choice.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBesides him there’s also a little more screen time for Ougi, built up as the true antagonist of the whole franchise, and her different interactions with Araragi and the rest of the cast are pretty enjoyable and intense at times, allowing the protagonist to be more expressive without as many internal monologues, while everyone else is skeptical of (her?) intentions and actions, and even try to stop them. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThere’s a newly introduced girl, Oikura, and what a messed up character with the most fucked up backdrop story by far. Much like Koyomi’s, her past in the school feels even pettier and her personality very exaggerated. As soon as her circumstances are shown, fortunately without an edgy approach, she becomes far easier to understand and tolerate. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe series makes a contrast between Araragi and Oikura while exploring them. His worldview crumbled and yet thanks to his circumstances, meeting the right people, and his own attitude, he powered through it and became a better person, when he is not acting like a degenerate. On the other hand, she didn’t have any of that, and went through much more serious stuff, so she pretty much became a mess and delved in self-pity and resolved to blame everyone else, much like Nadeko would do on a later arc that was shown in Second Season. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nHaving Hanekawa alongside Koyomi and being the one to confront her was a good move writing wise, because of both her personality and own character arc. Also, this one does a good job in setting up her actions in Hitagi End.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nWith all that said, I have to question the messages the arc sends, I doubt saying that is good to have someone to blame and hate for one’s own struggles for the sake of one’s own happiness, but at least the series itself turns against it at the end by having Oikura realize that she was the one on the wrong while hanging on a very thin line between sanity and insanity.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe other one is the usual of the franchise that you are the only one that can really help and save yourself and make your own happiness, which sounds really good on paper but just like Paranoia Agent, feels simplistic and not very empathetic, considering the circumstances of the characters, which in the case of Oikura become worse and worse.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe finale feels like a non-ending, as the girl gets a catharsis that even the series itself admits it’s quite anticlimactic, and it also doesn’t feel completely supported by the narrative. Despite having she realizing that she was wrong and that she has to stop blaming everyone else and make things better for herself, without a follow up to actually see that, it feels like something is missing.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAnd yet, somehow, it just…fits. The arc was quite distinctive for the usual pattern of the Monogatari series. Araragi can’t use his powers, he can’t rely on them to solve everything, there are no aberrations involved, it’s all about the mentality of the characters, the girl doesn’t want to be helped by Araragi, she doesn’t end joining his harem, she doesn’t try to solve her problems, nor self reflects enough nor gains a proper resolve and resolution at the end…and it fits, because she didn’t try that. If the arc somehow ended with everything being resolved and with a happy ending, it would make everything that led to it to feel superficial and the issues to be nowhere near as heavy as they were made out to be throughout the whole season at that point. So, it’s one of the saddest yet most fitting conclusions, based on the actions of the main girl. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAnother thing I want to point out about this arc is the proper tone. Even though there are some comical moments they are mostly subtle and do not clash with the overall serious mood, some even feel like the characters have passive-aggressive interactions so they don’t end up fighting among themselves, AND THERE IS NO FANSERVICE IN IT, which was something extremely welcomed by me.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIn terms of aesthetics, the arc goes back to what was done in Tsukimonogatari, which translates to good artwork and backgrounds, equally very little motions, and at times a bit too bright special effects, but overall a more polished version of that season in this regard.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe audio department, much like that series, has an electronic first opening and a typical jpop ending, in this case both with lyrics about two people being apart despite also being close, opening doors and trespassing borders, which fits what happens in it and the character Ougi (herself?). For some reason there are other two intros with Oikura as the main character instead of just one, and they are both among the best ones in the whole franchise in both music and visuals, and with lyrics that properly explores her mentality just like all the rest of them.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAs for the soundtrack, just like in Tsukimonogatari, it is much more intense and suspenseful than the previous shows, and since this arc is far more serious, it is also a more fitting and improved version of it. Even the comical passive-aggressive interactions among characters give a high sense of tension thanks to it. Sound effects and voice acting are as good as ever, with the exceptional performance of Marina Inoue in what has to be her best and most distinctive one, properly managing different changes in tone and volume for Oikura.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAs a whole it is an intense arc properly handled in terms of aesthetics, tone, pacing, character dynamics and resolution, although not as good in terms of how the messages are tied with the narrative, and the beginning isn’t on the same level that it ends up having as a whole.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe second arc is centered on Shinobu and it is essentially a resolution for her as Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade. Chronologically it takes place after Shinobu Time and around the same time as Tsubasa Tiger, from Second Season, so its ending leads directly to that arc.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAesthetically it doesn’t have the bright special effects of the previous arc, so it’s an improvement. It combines the presentation of the inner thoughts and passages of the light novel of the characters from Tsukimonogatari and the Oikura story, much shorter, slower and easier for the eye to catch them than the earlier seasons. It also has its fair share of well animated action and CGI for a samurai armor and its powers that are well rendered. It also uses the style of Kiss-Shot’s past in Second Season for a moment.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSince unfortunately the arc begins with a very silly tone, the background music is inferior in the beginning but gets to the same level of quality at a midpoint when it takes itself seriously, and the opening is Mein Schatz, easily the best theme in the franchise. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe beginning of the arc is not good as it is very silly and has a lot of comedy and meandering, and even some fanservice, affecting the pacing and going a step back in terms of quality. Once it gets serious however, it explains the setting in a way that was not done before in the franchise, directly tying it with practically every past action of the characters, thus making them face their responsibility for what they have unwillingly done and retroactively making the weird happenings to the cast to make a bit more sense in-story, although it still doesn’t explain why everyone else in the town is clueless about what happens.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIt has someone from Shinobu’s past as Kiss-Shot reappearing again and thus her having to stop running away from that character and face him, as Kanbaru tells her, in a scene that makes her seem more like the next protagonist of the franchise way more and way better than all of Hanamonogatari. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSo, it reinforces the same message of the rest of the franchise of the characters being the only ones that can solve their problems, thus they have to face them. Like with the previous arc in the season, it’s a bit lost in the narrative since at the end it’s Koyomi who solves the conflict with dirty tricks, but it is an alright message as usual.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nI also want to point out as a positive that Koyomi is put in a situation where he can’t be in three places at the same time solving the problems of everyone else, something that he is told throughout the franchise, thus he takes care of one situation, while trusting the others to someone else, as it was shown in Second Season.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAnd also, it ends with the message that oneself is the only one that can assure their own happiness, by beginning to actively search for it, something that changer Koyomi a little and a later point in time has a direct influence in the first arc of this particular season.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe conclusion is overall good for the season in terms of messages, themes, characterization, and as a closure for the second arc, but thanks to Koyomimonogatari, there’s still more stuff to cover, which is what the second entry is focused on.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSaid second entry begins right after the ending of Koyomimonogatari and despite being divided in three mini arcs, they take place one after the other in order, and the content on each of them is very simple, so I find no point in breaking them down as I did with the previous two. The beginning isn’t very promising, as it goes back to the aggressively stupid meandering, comedy and a little bit of pedophile humor and fanservice, while it also takes away the importance of death in the franchise even more and a bittersweet ending of a previous arc. Oh, an also, the backgrounds are at times very bright.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThankfully, as it happens with most arcs and series in the franchise, it becomes a bit more serious and overall better later as it goes on, but still, despite being the overall conclusion of everything, it never feels like there is much gravity and adequate seriousness in it, partly because the outcome is already known thanks to Hanamonogatari. You thought I would forget to mention it and blame it for the lack of tension? I never will.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe importance of the first mini arc comes to down to explaining the setting even more, through dialogues, because either the author or the studio clearly isn’t very good at showing instead of telling, and a certain way of doing things that take away a little of proactive initiative of some characters, but it also retroactively justifies what seemed to be scripted actions of some others, who have actually been preparing the outcome they wanted, instead of a predetermined one fabricated by someone else, while it also explores a very secondary character a little more.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAfterwards, the plot progress and it doesn’t at the same time, as pacing stays somewhat in a rare middle, with several character interactions that range from the normal to even the kind of metaphysical, that serve as a progression for the romantic aspect of the franchise, and as a setup for the conclusion of it as a whole, at least as far as the anime goes.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe conclusion still continues to explain the setting, in the same manner, and still keeps retroactively justifying actions of the characters and setting up the plan for the outcome and the conclusion, while it also gives an answer for the mystery behind everything, which is very simple and previously suspected by most people that have been following the franchise. It doesn’t surprise anyone, but it fits with the whole and the future, meaning, Hanamonogatari.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nWhat’s good about it is that it explains what every important character has been doing out of screen for the outcome to happen the way it does, and what the secondary ones kept doing with their lives, the bad thing is that the anime still doesn’t know how to show those things, so instead chooses to tell them.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe best aspect of the resolution and the season as a whole is how everything ends up being a product of the doings and the mentality of the main character. When I came to know about it I thought it would be very far-fetched and out there to be convincing, but thanks to all the previous build up from earlier entries, I find it to be fine. Also, as a message and closure for Araragi, it is nice that he finally does something for and by himself, and accepts his dark side, in a similar character arc of the one that Hanekawa had. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe bad thing is how it still happens through big conveniences and last minute apparitions and saves, as the series itself admits by calling them even miracles. The characters manage to fulfill a certain outcome and fool it at the same time, similarly to the ending of Jigokuraku, but they do it by making everything seem very easily solvable, ending everything in a fitting albeit a bit underwhelming way. Basically, the finale was a bit meh in terms of plot, but good as far as characterization, which is basically how the Monogatari franchise is as a whole, so it fits.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nVisually, after it gets rid of that super bright background, the season is among the best in that regard, if not the best, as it combines every visual trick used earlier, except for the art style used during Kiss-Shot’s past, even integrating the one that up until now was reserved only for the endings, and with a more…relaxed, and nowhere near as bombastic directing, making everything a bit…friendlier and easier for the eye to keep track, as well as read the light novel lines in between. The only issue is that, as usual, the motions aren’t very good.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAs the tone is much more lighthearted than it was in the previous season, the music takes a step back in quality as well. There is one ending that is the same as most of the earlier ones, and three openings, one akin to those of Hachikuji, which means I skipped it after the first time, another one similar to those of Hitagi, which means I didn’t find it special in any way but I still somewhat enjoyed for its retro aesthetics, this time in the music which gave me a very City Pop feeling, and a third one which I didn’t care about  and felt like a very inferior version of the one Ougi had before. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAs a whole, the resolution felt…appropriate, as it fits with what was previously done, and what was assured to happen next, while it also reveals what every character is up to or going to do next, as a form of catharsis, albeit it does it with not the best presentation and without making much sense thanks to the conveniences in the writing, while nothing feels very serious because of the very lighthearted tone. Basically, the franchise in a nutshell. I rate the first season with something between 6 and 7 out of ten, and the second barely with a 6.",

            "\r\nI wasn’t planning on giving my thoughts about the whole franchise in this review, since I still have one more entry left, but from what I read it’s just another filler season of mini stories like Koyomimonogatari, that takes place between this one and Hanamonogatari. I can’t imagine myself having much to say about something like that, let alone something positive, so I prefer this one to be my SECOND to last review of the whole series. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nFrom a critical stand point, the writing is cleverly done for the dialogues but nonsensical in terms of plot and logic for the most part, even if there are some explanations for the setting and the weird events at the end, and the progression is very slow thanks to a lot of meandering, hit or miss comedy that abuses of being referential, creepy fanservice, and some entries that could be reduced by a lot or skipped almost entirely. It is also just good enough in sound, despite the very good voice acting, and although the visuals are overall extremely good, a lot of the weird imagery doesn’t feel justified by the narrative and is there just because. It’s not the plot you watch this franchise for though, but rather the messages which are good albeit not very well delivered, and most of all the characters, which are among the most memorable and fleshed out casts in the medium, and far better than what anyone would expect from a harem, unless that someone consumes the genre specifically for the perverted situations and the fetishized archetypes that pose as characters.

That is why I personally prefer the manga version, which I’m close to finish, for being far faster and in my opinion more focused, even though it lacks a lot of the highlights of this one. If I go by numbers for all the seasons together, Monogatari ends up being barely a 5/10 as a whole, but if I rate everything as one big series, it goes up to something like a 6.5/10. I’m not satisfied with any option to be honest, as I find the first to be too low, and the second too high, so I settle for something in between. Meaning, I find it to be just barely something like a 6/10, nowhere near among the best in the medium by any stretch of the imagination, but not plainly a waste of time either.",

I was the best accomplice of this series and I did not give importance in the past but I got bored of the same grotesque joke again and again, which leads us to the following problem with these episodes, which is the repetition of the same old material, these episodes only repeats the same jokes and ideas that in previous seasons, these episodes did not innovate at all and you know what is worse than that? is that the people behind this work does not even try or care about the fact that they are just recycling the old stuff over and over again, they are hitting your head over and over again with the same old ideas and jokes until you say enough and I'm a fan who got tired of this deal, it is no longer funny, it is not innovative anymore, it is not even artistically pleasing as it was before.

Also includes many characters that are only present for a brief and insignificant moment, this is an insult to the characters themselves and fans of these characters, an absolute disgrace.

The fans are many, they will eat whatever it is, they must create something that many will like, easy to eat and bring it to their tables as fast as possible and the result is a hamburger. this is a hamburger that instead of having interesting dialogues full of new ideas is full of the greed of the people who are in the production studio, instead of having witty and provocative comedy has jokes about the tits of a little girl and instead of taking the time to develop the characters and be careful with their emotions has recycled material fresh from the trash.

That is until one night, a seemingly small event changes Dr. Tenma's life forever. While preparing to perform surgery on someone, he gets a call from the hospital director telling him to switch patients and instead perform life-saving brain surgery on a famous performer. His fellow doctors, fiancée, and the hospital director applaud his accomplishment; but because of the switch, a poor immigrant worker is dead, causing Dr. Tenma to have a crisis of conscience.",

Unfortunately, this choice leads to serious ramifications for Dr. Tenma—losing his social standing being one of them. However, with the mysterious death of the director and two other doctors, Dr. Tenma's position is restored. With no evidence to convict him, he is released and goes on to attain the position of hospital director. ",

            "\r\nI almost don't want to reveal what predictable things become annoying, because maybe the reader wouldn't have noticed it before I said anything. An example, we have a standoff. Two important characters, high suspense, one character pulls the trigger. GUNSHOT sound, cuts away to outside of building, leaving what happens a mystery. Hey, it's suspense! Another one; a character is talking, he will say \"blah blah blah, *pause* no, *pause* blah blah blah\". Why? Its all in the tension, Mr. Smith, no, Mr. Revealed! I know all about you know! It's an effective enough line that if one character had it, as a sort of signature line, it would have been amazing. However, when everyone has the same distinctive signature line, it gets rather silly. A fun little game to play with this anime is to try saying \"iie\" (\"no\") in unison with the character. Another quirky thing that many characters do verbally is repeat a word over and over again, as a sort of dramatic buildup. Often, this will lead up to a scream.  I commented to my friends that the dialogue seemed like it came from a comic book, and they couldn't help but agree. Here's another one: as a character is having a flashback, about to remember something important, something will always cut off the memory (unitl the end of course, when all the beans are spilled). Maybe an interruption, or else maybe she won't want to continue remembering. What we end up with are a gadzillion flashbacks.

Dr. Tenma is wanted, his face has been all over the news, and he just walks around in broad daylight and is surprised when he is caught. I mean, really? In many cases, he's behaving quite suspiciously too, just begging for attention to be drawn to him. An amusing example of a detail that didn't make sense was when a character walked into a room, she was perfectly composed. She pulls out a gun, and *suddenly* she is completely out of breath, as if she had just run a marathon. Yes, I know pulling a gun on someone is exciting, but it was completely ridiculous. A detail that more amused me than bothered me was the way they used guns in this show. A detective walks into a room, points a gun randomly in one direction, suddenly swerves to point randomly in another direction, and then suddenly swerves once again to point randomly at the camera, before putting the gun down and looking around. If a bad guy was actually where the camera was at, he would have shot the detective as soon as he walked in, but hey, pointing the gun in random directions is exciting! ",

His wife is the most annoyed I have been by a woman since Milly in an anime. Her entire role is to be a shrew who grapples with her hatred and love for Tenma and complains a lot. I mean A LOT.

I have a theory that the creators thought about the start and end, but only partially. Like, they gave a few hidden foreshadowing in the beginning, but the end was mostly improvised. It wouldn't be too outlandish as this is primarily a shounen anime where cool stuff happens first and writing/ plot comes second.

On his travels he comes across the likes of Wolf Kanagushi and Goromaki Gondo, men who unintentionally fan the dying embers inside him, leading him to putting his wanderings to an end. His return home puts Joe back on the path to boxing, but unknown to himself and his trainer, he now suffers deep-set issues holding him back from fighting. In attempt to quell those issues, Carlos Rivera, a world renowned boxer is invited from Venezuela to help Joe recover."

The first and last fight of this season are easily among the best anime fights of all time. However the arcs in between these fights are the problematic ones.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThese arcs just feel like filler to delay the final confrontation with Jose. Each match's result is predictable and the fights themselves arent that good. The reason why rikiishi vs joe is considered as one of the anime fights of all time is because despite being long it never feels boring. The fight starts before their actual match with rikiishi trying to lose weight and joe training to counter rikiishi's uppercut . As a result i was already at the edge of my seat when the match began and wasnt let down by the way it progressed from there on. Because rikiishi's techniques are hidden to the viewer you dont know what will happen next or who will win the fight. Which is why the whole thing is such a joy to watch. Even after the match ends it can shock you yet again and that's how you write a legendary fight. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nUnfortunately the middle arcs of ashita no joe 2 have none of that. Joe's weight loss is dumb on so many levels and isnt brought up ever again. Kim yong bi's back story was interesting at first but then it finishes with him not ever getting haungry ever again which is just anime bullshit and it really feels forced as a result. The fight itself isnt very good either with him only having one secret move and joe surviving on spirits alone. The same is true for the rest of the matches in the middle part. Harimao, the afro guy that was so imporant i forgot his name and the other boxers i dont remember enough to even describe all have one gimmick at best that beat the fuck out of joe in the first rounds but then he finds a way around them and wins the match. There are no pre match trainings before these fights and no new techniques are developed unlike the first season which means joe will go in the ring and randomly throws fists until he wins. This works in the final fight because Its such an imporant moment in the story but the fight with that afro guy? You cant tell me it has the same build up. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe other major flaw with ashita no joe 2 is how it treats its characters. Joe and yoko are the only ones that get any proper development while danpei and nishi dont change at all through this season. It doesnt help that most of joe's oponnents are completely one note and for the ones that arent i only liked carlos mainly due to his personality. Jose and the korean dude were interesting at first but fell flat to me by the end.",

Art improved but animation remained mediocre. The backbone of the story is still incredibly strong, strong enough for a lot of people to enjoy and understand the themes and arcs of the original but that's what makes it so hard to recommend after reading the manga.

            "\n        The Dangers in My Heart Season 2 was an incredible run from start to finish, and I cannot believe how far we have come since the “cringe” start at the beginning of this series. This season has provided a ton of fun, quite a few laughs, quite a few pay-offs, and some emotional moments as well. Apart from the sheer sweetness of this series, Kyoutarou’s growth has been incredible to watch, and as someone who shares some of the same traits as him, like being an introvert, some of his character growth really resonated with me, and he continues to be easily my favourite character\n                  ",
            "\n          ",

            "in this series. It is so early in the year, but it is already an anime of the year contender for me.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nI tend to like most romance anime that I have watched, but the one wall that they almost always hit is never really escaping the “Will they, won’t they?” phase of the show. Characters meander and the story progression goes at a snail’s pace, which in due time, makes the story lose its charm. A big reason for that is the caricatures and tropes of the characters that are in love. For example, whenever the main female character is a tsundere, all we see is her punching the dude or denying her feelings. In this show, there is no such annoying trope, and the dynamic between the two leads is a breath of fresh air. It’s just two somewhat socially awkward teens just getting to understand one another, without the progression being too dragged out. Of course, I also love seeing the female lead be taller than the male lead, as it is just a unique touch to the whole dynamic.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAnother aspect of the series I really enjoy are some of the subtleties to the character growth. The characters feel somewhat realistic, in that they physically grow, something normal for their age of course. Kyoutarou grows a little taller, his voice deepens a bit, and Anna might be a bit excited, but it was never a huge deal. The characters understand more about one another at a nice pace. What was unknown at one point gets learned later on, such as when Anna understands how Kyoutarou would retract back into his shell when he was in certain situations, or Kyoutarou would understand how Anna would feel at a particular time. When they talk to each other, they might stumble on their words sometimes, but when it matters, they know exactly what to say. Overall, I really enjoyed how the show never got “in your face” about the character growth.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nKyoutarou has been a pretty relatable character to me to some extent, especially with his introversion. Kyoutarou's challenges with socializing and public speaking kind of resemble how parts of my life have went. I was a pretty chatty kid, but as I grew into my teenage years, for some reason I got more reserved, and I had stage fright and a fear of public speaking. Yeah, I took drama classes, and classes that required me to talk with others, but I was not, and still am not the most talkative person around in the slightest. Whenever I saw Kyoutarou talk to his inner self, while it might feel somewhat cliché, it always was executed perfectly because it acknowledges that a lot of the time, the biggest thing holding someone back is themselves. Deep down, they know they can do whatever they set their mind to, but they sell themselves short. Like people say, sometimes a person's worst enemy is themselves, so whenever Kyoutarou achieved something substantial, I was so proud of him. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAs for the other characters, there aren’t any real weaknesses to the cast. Anna of course is a very cute, somewhat awkward character that put a lot of proactive care into developing the relationship further. Most of the other characters were really fun to watch, and support the main duo very well. They all know about Kyoutarou and Anna’s blossoming relationship, but they always let the two grow by themselves (save for that flash mob group), even if they would sometimes create situations where that was possible. The parents, relatives, friends, everyone in their social circle were so supportive, and happy whenever both Kyoutarou or Anna were successful, to the point where it would always warm my heart. No unnecessary family drama, no unnecessary love triangles, just friends and family being wholesome and supportive. Moeko and Kana probably had the best moments as side characters, but there is not one bad character in this series. No, not even the perverted guys. Sure, it might be a bit exaggerated, but people at that age always have something dirty to talk about.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe visuals and directing were for the most part, very solid. The blurriness does get a little much at times, but it never hindered my enjoyment. The staff did a fantastic job of really having the emotional moments hit hard. Kensuke Ushio, who worked on the music, continues to show that he is one of the best in the business right now, right there with Kevin Penkin and Evan Call, possibly Hiroyuki Sawano as well, at really elevating the show to new heights.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIt has been nothing but joy watching this show every week. I never thought a romcom could surpass *Kaguya-sama: Love is War* for me, but this has been something truly special. The sheer state of giddiness I would be in before starting each episode was a testament to how much of an impact this show has had on me. Whether or not we see this series return anytime soon, it’ll still hold a place near and dear to my heart, which was in danger almost every week of watching this.",

            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe plot, unfortunately, is one of two things that sticks out to me as the one aspect of the anime that could probably have been done better. Yes, there's some character development throughout the two seasons, but one feels like most of the development was done during the first season. As for the romance aspect, the ending had already been established in the first season, and the second season, in my opinion, could have done a little more to continue making viewers glued to the screen. There are hints of a couple between two characters (which I'm not going to name), but isn't built upon enough for viewers to truly care about them. Sure, there's some episodes that really make you laugh and smile like an idiot, but the momentum, unlike the first season, was a bit more blunted. I would also argue that there isn't as much of a conflict this season as there was the first season, which means even less of a pull factor to viewers. However, they do still excel in making scenes that make viewers go \"how the heck did they get here?\" which is a plus in this criterion at least. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSome of the characters were very disappointing misses. The two characters introduced at the later half of the anime, Andou Kanna and Yurine Hanzawa, were created to add a bit of tension to the season, but not nearly enough to truly make a difference in the minds of the viewers. If they had a bit more character development other than being there just to act as a bit of comic relief and force to push the main characters together, that would have, in my opinion, been a little better for the anime as a whole. The female main character's friends also suffer from a lack of development, not having been built upon enough to make the viewers relate with them. Why can I say this? Because when a character is truly memorable, viewers will remember their names. I couldn't for this anime- for nearly all the characters except for a few.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nHowever, now we talk about the great parts of this anime. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nFor every disappointing miss, there was a character that really felt as if the producers really nurtured with all their hearts. Sho Adachi, one of the male main character's friends, is one of them. Sure, he's still the typical pervert friend whose only dream is to look at melons all day long, but he gains an extra dimension in this season, which makes him a lot more bearable. Kenta Kanzaki, another one of the male main character's friends, is a great side character, combining with Honoka Hara to make quite the interesting side couple whose names I could actually remember. There's actual conflict, there's some chemistry between them that really grows on the viewers after a while, and they truly were great hits.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nWith all that said, we go to the main characters. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nWow. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nI know I've probably written a lot already, but this shows how much I became invested in the show. A big part of that is with the main characters. Kyotaro Ichikawa still shows a little bit of his chuunibyou tendencies, but he's largely shed all that to show a more socially awkward side of him, which I really like. Another thing that I really like is his smile, which while goes with the \"moody guy shows smile for the first time\", somehow manages to touch hearts really well. He's also become a lot more relatable, because which boy doesn't go \"Does she like me? Does she hate me? Maybe I shouldn't be with her...\" all those insecure thoughts that typical males with even the slightest bit of hesitation would have. However, it isn't a romance comedy without the comedy, and he really shines in that aspect with his continued snarky remarks that manages to force surprised snorts out of me. Anna Yamada is also very relatable, with all her anxieties and fears presenting a stark contrast to her outspoken and bubbly exterior. While being quite aloof at the beginning, she does evolve into a character that can be sympathized with, a character whose journey can be cheered on by viewers who see her as someone that should be cared about. From her underlying insecurities to her touching emotional sensitivities, Anna Yamada is a three dimensional character that epitomizes the saying, \"Don't judge a book by its cover\".",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAnd of course, we must talk about the music. As an idea of how good it is, I normally only watch the opening and ending themes of an anime during the final episode of the season. To be fair, I did that with the ending song, which is ok; not too bad, not too good either. However, with the consideration that I've been listening to the opening theme of The Dangers in My Heart Season 2 since I've started writing this ridiculously long review should amount for something. The animation, once again, is top-notch; the producers really poured their time and effort into an opening theme worthy of a great anime. While starting off quite simple, the opening theme goes on to capture my heart with lyrics that truly feel like the main characters would have sung if they had sung a duet together.",

            "glories: from Tite Kubo's Bleach's decade-long wait for a triumphant return still being one of the Big 3, to the much-anticipated Tatsuki Fujimoto's Chainsaw Man being studio MAPPA's massively high-profile equivalent to Ufotable's Demon Slayer in terms of story and animation prowess. However, there are certain shows that as humble as they come initially being an afterthought, to then unexpectedly and shockingly take the sweeping crown, those are the shows that we the anime community can call it special to begin with. It's more impressive even, when such a stacked season as this manages to live up to the hype, that it gets overshadowed by the mainstream being a hidden diamond gem in the works. And my friends, that show is mangaka Aki Hamaji's Bocchi the Rock!, easily the most anticipated of CloverWorks's produced shows of the year when the initial teaser trailer dropped to leave a vague message of its 2022 release in December last year, only to leave us hanging in nerve-wrecking-ness until the PV's release just right before the Fall season started rolling.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBefore I dive deep into this unexpected, hype-deserved acclaim of a masterpiece show that deserves more than being reduced to an excellent adaptation, I feel like I need to clarify something which the anime community has more often than not, got some facts wrong. Despite Bocchi the Rock! being serialized in publishing company Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara magazine (that's where all of the 4-koma manga come from) promoting its CGDCT theme, it is NOT considered as a genre, but rather a SUB-genre of Slice-of-Life, the same as how Isekai is a subgenre of Fantasy. It's actually more of a motif or theme because it uses a set of tropes and archetypes that separate it from other Slice-of-Life shows that makes it distinct, but thanks to the modern anime community that we have these days (and so much so that I'm a victim of it because I REALLY love CGDCT shows, albeit specifically), we sort of treat it as its own unofficial distinct genre: the human fault we call recency bias. And to be clear, Bocchi! the Rock! is not necessarily a CGDCT anime, but rather, a parody of both the CGDCT theme and the SoL genre, since it's given genre of comedy reflects it as such: a culmination of traits already done and perfected by other SoL and CGDCT anime.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBut still, you can't deny that the show pays an homage to one of the greatest CGDCT anime of all time: the legendary monumental classic and moe-blob phenomenon that is K-On!, serving the same SoL genre for the anime community, both past and present respectively. So figuratively, while we can call Bocchi the Rock! the GOAT CGDCT of the modern day, as a collective whole, I feel that there're better CGDCT shows than this: say this season's Do It Yourself!!, and while not quite moe-blob as one trait that defined SoL, is still very enjoyable. CGDCT fans are really eating REAL GOOD in 2022, especially considering that it's CloverWorks leading the charge, from the likes of Winter's Akebi-chan no Sailor-fuku a.k.a Akebi's Sailor Uniform that unfortunately had the confirmation bias of \"animation carried the show\" to Spring's Kunoichi Tsubaki no Mune no Uchi a.k.a In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki which turned out decent, along with other returning classics like Machikado Mazoku a.k.a. The Demon Girl Next Door, Yuru Camp△ the Movie (which is arguably the best of the series yet) and Yama no Susume a.k.a Encouragement of Climb.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nLet's be real: social anxiety IS a thing, and it culminates in the form of Social Anxiety disorder (SAD) a.k.a social phobia, characterized by sentiments of fear and anxiety in social situations, causing considerable distress and impaired ability to function in at least some aspects of daily life. These fears can be triggered by perceived or actual scrutiny from others. Individuals with social anxiety disorder fear negative evaluations from other people. And this is what exactly happens to a certain pink-haired Hitori \"Bocchi\" Gotoh trying her best not to shit herself socially, but from the outset, her growing-up life has been met with nothing but insecurities: from the lone effort of making friends to being a ghostly outcast in school, so much so that she becomes a closed closet Hikikomori a.k.a acute social withdrawal, referring to both the phenomenon in general and the recluses themselves: described as loners or \"modern-day hermits\", regarding themsleves as being totally withdrawn from society and seeking extreme degrees of social isolation and confinement, which in the real-life context of Japan, is a seriously grave issue, especially if you have seen Spring 2019's Hitoribocchi no Marumaru Seikatsu, being the show with the most acute similarity. To counteract from being a Hikikomori, Hitori engages in the online spectrum hoping to find friends there in the veins of YouTube being the illusive ever-so-slightly-named alias \"guitarhero\" that amasses a respectable subscriber fanbase for her guitar plays that are uploaded every once so often to satisate her followers.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThat is, until Hitori steps out into the real world where and she is submitted to the harshness of reality slapping her face in both directions, as much as she herself wants to get out of this rut and at least make a life-changing decision for herself. That decision comes in the form of a person: the blonde-haired Nijika Ijichi, who saw Bocchi juat lazing with her guitar and without words of explanation, forcefully dragged her to the underground livehouse that is STARRY as a last-minute replacement for the guitarist that abruptly left the group before their performance. And together with Nijika and the blue-haired bassist bandmate Ryo Yamada, the performance might have been a total wrecking ball of a complete poor failure, and at the very least Hitori knows that both are fans of her \"guitarhero\" YouTube persona, but with her social anxiety preventing any further conversation and ultimately withdrawing into the same recluse as she was before. Sure, Hitori might've gained her \"Bocchi\" nickname not because it rhymes with the \"hitoribocchi\" a.k.a All Alone pun, but it's a sign that at least acknowledged her presence more than anything. This is further cemented with Ikuyo Kita, the vocalist-cum-guitarist and initally Bocchi's classmate, when the latter requests her help to improve on her guitar playing skills, and the deal is struck since the former has an overwhelming infatuation on Ryo. Thereby, which was learnt later that Kita was the one that Nijika had Bocchi hurriedly filled in at the very last minute because she was not being honest with her feelings and fled the \"crime scene\" after the realization that Kita's guitar playing was not up to snuff. Together, the 4 girls make up Kessoku (lit. Zip Tie) Band: the center band of the series, and their endeavours together are a sight to behold, other than the highlight that is Bocchi's exaggerated, over-the-top, visual medium crossovers of her inner thoughts exemplified at the highest, most extreme degrees of insanity that exudes overflowing creativity of nonchalant acerbity that's some one-of-a-kind talent that you don't normally see in AniManga, let alone the manga chapters that if you read alongside the anime, each and every chapter title page paying homage to famous bands and their songs' music video. Also, there're tons of references plastered throughout the anime, even more than Chainsaw Man's OP, and that's saying quite a lot. So have fun in figuring out this too!",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nTo really understand how much Bocchi the Rock! got all of this deserved hype that we're only seeing right now, we have to go back in time to even before the anime was ever a thing:",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe year was 2019, and mangaka Aki Hamaji's work was just 2 years old at this point with only Volume 1 being released and Volume 2 set to be released the very next year. The debut chief animation director and character designer that was a nobody at the time, Kiyoki Rikuta a.k.a Kerorira was just about in the anime industry for little over a year or two doing key animations for a large variety of shows, most of which was under CloverWorks about months since the separation of the studio from A-1 Pictures, that still is under the Aniplex brand. Normally when an anime project is announced, the director or producers will be pushing forth and calling people up for the task, but in the case for Bocchi the Rock!, it was the key animator himself who pushed for the project, so much that it’s worth noting that it wasn’t a particularly shocking reveal. Since being open about his love for the series, Kerorira has gushed to the point of sharing short, animated clips of it on social media a.k.a Japanese Twitter. And when it came time to find people to helm the project, he went to the long-time veteran producer Shouta Umehara requesting people that he'd like to work with, such is the case for a certain Keiichiro Saito, that like Kerorira, he is also working in key animation and has become quite the veteran for years, that with this show, marks his official debut has series director. But if you know anything about the anime industry, especially when it comes to freelance works, it's talent and drive that makes the shows work, and without the help of Shouta Umehara and his exceptional scouting abilities, plus the boldness to bet on fresh, young and unproven talent while managing Aniplex's woeful corporation slavery management, Bocchi the Rock! really wouldn't have turned out the way it is today. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nEven I have to admit, it is a HUGE RISK betting shows on unproven talent. And speaking of Keiichiro Saito, his experience as a key animator whether in theme songs or episodes, these don't often typically give opportunities for people to train to be better as the grind of seasonal shows gleam along with none the wiser. It's only until Saito-san himself has an opportunity to work with the legendary director Shingo Natsume on his own experimental creation in the form of Summer 2021's Sonny Boy, that he is given the chance to learn the ropes and showcase his indomitable idiosyncrasy's worth of talent, such as the case where he contributed a lot to the anime for Episode 8. Back to Bocchi the Rock!, when Saito-san was offered the chance to read Aki Hamaji's manga with its only premiere volume out, by the time he'd finished reading it, his impression had changed, and found it to be a smart work in many ways: succeeding at both humor as a slice-of-life comedy and depicting its characters as a coming-of-age drama, with sharp jokes. This immaculate delivery would just not work based on one person's effort alone, and this is where scriptwriter and series composer Erika Yoshida steps in to help him visualize the vision that despite Bocchi the Rock! not being a fundamentally transformative adaptation, simply tweaking the orignal work with Yoshida-san's help certainly was a match made in heaven, most presumably when anime detracts out of its medium to do a 4th wall breaking on animation prowess that includes some live-action footage, because the hell why not, while focusing his directorial efforts on enhancing the themes that the original work could never develop. An amusing gag series about a lonely girl is now animating loneliness, giving the original work a whole new layer of emotional resonance to it while maintaining its original fun that's only possible in the hands of an exceptional animation team like the one that has surrounded this core team, and with promises such as the fully 2D live performances that involve 3D-ish rotoscoping (as an example) used to its maximum potential.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nFor an unproven team of supposedly misfits, Bocchi the Rock!'s shining moments are with its staff team, and it certainly can't be imitated outright on this kind of insane magnitude. One key phrase that Keiichiro Saito shared is that starting out as a key animator, his eye for craftsmanship on how people and objects move elevates the anime by giving it massive attention for its many poses. As an example, there’s a scene after their first live performance where Hitori creeps up closer to the others (this is in Episode 1 of the anime), and where Hitori is moving in an eccentric manner, how can the staff team make it funnier and bring out more of her personality? He spent a lot of time thinking about how it could be made funny in animated form, and not forgetting that for the performance scenes, using footage of real-life actors performing as the base for the animation, and solely requesting them to keep in mind the characterization, as well as replicating the performance itself. Even more so regarding the orignal source's 4-koma format, there is a lot to fill in along the lines, and along the way, both Saito-san and Erika Yoshida found out that by inserting realism into the anime, it loses the gloss and charms of the original work. So, by adding in methods and approaches exclusive to animation, as well as adding supplementary gags for connecting scenes with help from the manga staff, it helps give the anime a life of its own that doesn't discredit where it came from. Truly, all of this sounds like a passion project, and yes, it is. It's talent that you only see once in a blue moon, and for that it is commendable.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nEasily the character on note, Hitori \"Bocchi\" Gotoh is the one that everyone in the production staff team is looking out for, being the weird oddball that's different from everyone else. Of course, trying to manage expectations on how to be sure on animating Bocchi's 1001 expressions is no easy task, so a balance is necessary, because while Bocchi inflicts us the audience being oh-so-freakishly relatable with her poor communication skills, making sure not to come off too strong or otherwise, making those watching feel bad. One thing about Hitori is that she also possesses extraordinary skills, so Saito-san and his team strived to depict both her positive and negative traits as a character in a memorable way, making the audience laugh when she does something weird, but also make her especially captivating when she shows off her cool side from time to time. This is especially for Kerorira, making his debut as both character designer animation director, that the obscene fan of the manga has a lot on his plate to consider as well. It's not just the extreme introvert herself that he has to contend with, but also considering the others as well (Ryo, Nijika and Kita) in their unique expressions as well. One thing that Geoff Thew of Mother's Basement actually captured when it comes to character designs, comes with the characters' hair positions that tell us something about them: Nijika’s antenna, for example, is a simple triangle, and Hitori’s tied-up hair isn’t actually connected. This is due in part to depicting anime-like designs that aren’t possible in reality and was a major necessity to create character designs that look appealing at first sight than those that conform to reality.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBut Bocchi the Rock! isn't so much about Hitori herself, it's the others that help Bocchi be a better girl that as socially inept as she is, it's a growing journry that fits the confines of a coming-of-age melodrama in the most hilarious way possible. Starting with Nijika Ijichi herself, the founder of Kessoku Band and the group's drummer, she stands as one of the most understanding and caring members of the group being the general extrovert, and always constantly holds Bocchi together in helping her deal with her social anxiety. It helps that her older sister Seika is also coincidentally the manager-cum-owner of the livehouse located in Shimokitazawa, so the livehouse is actually treated like their main home when gigs are always in abundance. For the band's bassist Ryo Yamada, other than the requirement not to date the 3Bs of \"Bassist, bassist, bassist\", Ryo may seem like an introvert, but she is in fact a loner by choice (get the distinction right, folks). The aloof, quiet and mischievous girl with a cool demeanor and a bisexual appearance, she is the epitome of cheap molasses, as everything in life is served to her palate, be it food or allowance money, even to the point of eating weeds just to survive. Last but not least, the band's vocalist-cum-(formerly) guitarist Ikuyo Kita herself, the extreme extrovery with her oh-so-gleaming \"Kita~aura\" that it's hard to resist her claims, especially when shoved towards Bocchi's face. But her real reason of escapism from Kessoku Band because of her infatuation with the bisexual-looking Ryo and the general expectations from people to promise them like a people-pleaser, man it just hits hard when even Kita herself is vulnerable to the human conforming mindset that really, no character is 100% perfect, and each and every member's SWOT Analyses are what band the rag-tag group together as they aim for stardom. Oh, and for the eagle-eyed of you who are into Anisong, did you notice something striking? Just look into the family names of the 4 girls, and you'll soon realize that they're derived from one of the legendary J-Rock bands of all time: AKFG a.k.a Asian Kung-Fu Generation, with their instrumental roles being an obvious match: Hitori like Masagumi Gotoh on rhythm guitar, Nijika like Kiyoshi Ijichi on drums, Ryo like Takahiro Yamada on bass, and Ikuyo like Kensuke Kita on lead guitar, but also being lead vocals.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nA special mention would be the side characters, most particularly Kikuri Hiroi: the alcoholic who spends her money on booze (or beer as is known elsewhere), encountering Bocchi and striking out a deal with her to do a live, impromptu performance out on the streets, taking a chance for the extreme Hikikomori herself to overcome her fears in front of the general public. What you may not know is that the psychedelic rock band SICK HACK's lead bassist and vocalist herself, like Bocchi an the rest, they do share their last names with another real-life band: 88Kasyo Junrei a.k.a 88Kasyo, with Kikuri herself being like Margaret Hiroi, adjectively described as \"the bassist, singer and the gang's mastermind\". Not to be outdone, Hitori's family shold be given credit here as well for their role in bringing up the once-labelled Hikikomori herself: father Naoki, mother Michiyo, younger sister Futari (which means two people) and the pet dog JimiHen. If you have to start a comedy somewhere, why not from the family itself? Futari is easily a savage character in front of her Onee-san, and as much as she wants to gush of Hitori's greatness, it comes at the cost of the older sister's warped mentality to respond to things that she doesn't mean literally.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nCloverWorks has done a fair few SoL shows in that regard (see Slow Start and this year's CGDCT offerings), but Bocchi the Rock! has got to be the studio's biggest undertaking since its separation from A-1 Pictures, and even then, it's only on the cusps of people relations and knowing who to find and perfect this ordinary looking 4-koma manga adaptation. I've already gushed at how utterly and brillantly magnificent are the production team's efforts at elevating Aki Hamaji's manga, and for the first-time debuts like Keiichiro Saito and Kerorira, if not for producer Shouta Umehara having that fine level of trust that young-uns can make it into the industry (a level that was once had for the controversial Wonder Egg Priority) with relative experience under their belt, it's like the adage of \"nothing ventured, nothing gained\". It's a risk, but a risk that while the reception in Japan is lukewarm to say the least, it bombed everywhere else outside of Japan. In a glorifyingly great way to end 2022 as THE golden year for CGDCT anime.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe one oddity is that while series director Keiichiro Saito's team has full creative control of the anime, the OST is where things could've gone awry. And especially since this is an Aniplex-produced show, tensions run high since the music production falls into the hands of Aniplex themselves, and Saito-san had to be careful with his consultation with the music team on what works and what doesn't. Because even such a minor slip-up can cause the biggest of headaches that potentially could detract the viewing experience, and hearing this from producer Shouta Umehara himself, the biggest issue with the completely separated entity was whether the musical direction that the mangaka Aki Hamaji had envisioned for Bocchi the Rock! and Kessoku Band could be carried out, and thankfully that’s one area in which Aniplex really gave it their all. And it sounds absolutely fantastic, from the OP/ED theme songs and even the insert songs when Kessoku Band is called to enact performances.",

            "\r\n- It’s like they gave K-On! to someone who adored Hitoribocchi, coupled with stupidly good animation, and a dash of Pop Team Epic sensibilities, combining animation with live action settings and other forms of mixed media.",
            "\r\n- Hitoribocchi no Marumaru Seikatsu is a much better comparison.

We can say that Kerorira single-handedly carried the anime due to his love and passion that has grown from just social sharings to a full-blown anime production with support from the people he had hoped to work with. His dream is finally realized, and not a lot of people have that tenure of grace to ever be in a totally completely complete directive control of their own anime, say Akane Kazuki with his own created series Hoshiai no Sora a.k.a Stars Align that got the axe at the eleventh hour.

Truly a hidden gem that has long awaited to rise up towards reaching out for the masterpiece medal, and it clinched with many hurdles to overcome, but it eventually did while reaching its intended finish line, cementing itself as the Pinnacle of the Best CGDCT of all time (if by MAL scores alone).",

One of the main points of appeal of this show, is, of course, the relatability of Bocchi's character. From that perspective, she is well-written, and her portrayal of social anxiety strikes just the right chords to get the viewer to care and relate to her. Of course, if you can't empathize with a socially anxious person, much of the comedy falls flat - but despite BTR being a comedy show, that surprisingly doesn't really take away from its overall enjoyability.",

            "\r\nFor starters, the production of the show is immaculate - sure, the level of smoothness a blockbuster shounen like attack on titan sees isn't really present, but the direction is top notch, and the creativity levels are there, from the wacky facial expressions to the shots of real-life action that are very tastefully strung into the artwork - and to that end, I applaud Bocchi the rock. As far as slice-of-life shows go, it's presented beautifully, and the passion the animators and director had for the project is tangible - not entirely unexpected work from Keiichirou Saitou, who worked on shows like Sonny Boy, Mob Psycho and Wonder Egg Priority in recent memory, all deeply charismatic and atmospheric in their own ways.",

Both the opening and ending sequences are spectacular, and the OSTs are even better; the first track the girls write in the show, entitled \"Guitar, Loneliness and Blue Planet\", is, as far as J-Rock goes, one of the best songs I've ever heard in anime.

For Subaru's Re:Zero, that's in the form of killing off the entire (incredibly obnoxious) main cast in increasingly gruesome and brutal ways to little purpose other than shocking the viewer into tears. For Koe no Katachi, it's using Nishimiya's entire character as a glorified cardboard cutout to plaster a disability onto and get the audience to cry over it, which is a lot more evocative of what BTR attempts to do with Bocchi's social anxiety.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIt's cheap writing and emotionally exploitative. Although Bocchi the Rock doesn't abuse this trick to the same extent as the anime I previously mentioned, it doesn't mean it's in good taste, either. Crippling social anxiety that impairs someone from even the most basic human functions, is, more or less, the running gag of the show, which sure, fine, it's a comedy, and I'm a strong believer in being able to make jokes about anything and everything, but there's two issues I still have with it.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nObviously, this is a cute girls doing cute things comedy, so I can't bring myself to do a psychological analysis of Bocchi; that's just as in bad taste as the show itself and entirely missing the point. Still, social anxiety is a mental health issue that has a root cause - abusive household, severe bullying, lack of human interaction, poor upbringing, a track record of being constantly mercilessly rejected, or whatever else you might think up. Yet Bocchi lives in a nice big house in a nice neighbourhood, she has a nice little sister and two supportive, able-bodied parents, was never bullied (or at least, the show never mentioned it), and just in general is a really cute anime girl who plays guitar and runs a youtube channel in her spare time, so really, her character is reduced to little more than a device to get the audience to think \"she just like me fr\" instead of a genuine, real, believable human being with feelings and motivations beyond what the writers tell us her feelings are. Although the show narrates mostly from the view of Bocchi, making all encounters into a deeply intimate experience, she remains shallow, written solely to make the audience empathize with her because of her situation, instead of her character.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBut again, analyzing Bocchi is senseless since this is a comedy, not a drama, so I can't discredit it for using a character as a running gag - it's something many other superb comedy shows do regularly. Still, AS a comedy, BTR entirely misses the mark, simply because its jokes aren't that funny. To some people, they're very relatable situations, and therefore mildly funny, but to the viewer without social anxiety, who can't empathize with Bocchi, every. single. damn. joke. falls flat in its face. Its comedy is entirely reliant on getting the viewer to sympathize and relate to Bocchi, which brings me back to how her \"she just like me fr fr!\" writing is cheap, and to how distasteful it is to use mental health issues as a device to sell jokes for the entire runtime of the show.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThis feels like a great time to mention a show I've recently watched - Hinamatsuri. Hinamatsuri is a comedy show, yes, and it has a side character called Anzu. Without spoiling too much, Anzu's character approaches a pretty serious theme - homelessness, yet never does the show try to make you cry just because oh, poor Anzu she's homeless, nor does it tastelessly poke fun at homeless people. Homelessness isn’t exactly something relatable to most people, it's a topic that's not as easily exploitable as social anxiety, so the writers turn Anzu into more than a social anxiety bag or a disabled damsel-in-distress (cough, koe no katachi, cough) through believable characterization and a great story arc. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nQuickly going through the plot, Anzu has great magical powers and has come to Earth to fight the titular protagonist, Hina. She is introduced as impulsive, aggressive, and unrelenting in her egocentrism. She fails to beat Hina, and also finds out she’s unable to return to the world she came from; Now stuck on earth, she steals to get by until she meets a homeless guy who teaches him that’s wrong, and Anzu joins his community of homeless people. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nOver the course of the next few episodes, Anzu learns the ins and outs of homeless life - picking up cans off the ground to sell to the scrapyard and getting 500 yen for a whole day of backbreaking work. Slowly, Anzu learns the value of money and the importance of sharing moments with others, thanks to her new living environment; The other homeless people in the community teach her other things too, anything from building a house to crocheting rubber bands, and when the time finally came for her to split apart from the rest of the homeless group - they arrange for her to be adopted -, she feels incompetent and powerless in her inability to be anything more than a bother for the nice people who helped her. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nObviously, since Hinamatsuri is a comedy, sometimes it’s all exaggerated for comedic effect - when she first starts working for her adoptive family’s ramen shop, she asks a customer how he’s so wealthy after ordering an 800 yen dish - but her character arc and development is genuine, the lessons she learns are genuine, and the social issues tackled by the writers are approached with tact and care in order to build a story that doesn't make you cry because \"Oh, crying reason spotted\", but because you genuinely believe in and care for the character who makes it all happen. That, right there, is tasteful, good writing, and something a show like Bocchi the Rock simply lacks.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nStill, I do have one concession to make. I've written this review so far in such a way that Bocchi has been put in a bad light and portrayed as a weak character, which she isn't completely. She is cheaply written, yes, but her portrayal of social anxiety - although exaggerated for comedic purposes - is believable at times, which is probably why so many people who also struggle with similar troubles in their daily lives love the show. In fact I'll add one more - her character development is genuinely well written, particularly in episode 6, where Bocchi meets Hiroi, a bassist from another band randomly out on the street, and Hiroi convinces Bocchi to do a street performance - which she absolutely kills. By the end of the episode, Bocchi makes a new friend and achieves her goal for the episode, which involves talking to and convincing a whole three people, probably something even an adept social butterfly would struggle to do effortlessly.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nUnfortunately, the comedic nature of the series means that much of this character development is often reverted and forgotten by the end of one episode, but still, it's easy to tell that by the end of the show, Bocchi was a completely different, far more approachable person than she was at the start of the season, and the journey she goes through to get there is not just believable but also entertaining.",

Every action a character takes and feeling they feel are not reactive to their environment, but pre-scripted and carefully designed to serve the purpose of the story - and it seems to me like the purpose the writer(s) behind BTR strived for was more about making their show a commercial success rather than writing what could really have been a great series and character.",

How successful the show is in achieving its loftier goals might come down to whether you can or can't tolerate the exploitative nature of its titular character, who, more than a believable and meaningful portrayal of social anxiety, chooses instead to be an \"oh she just like me frrrrrr!!!!!!\" character.

            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSimilar to what some people might notice in the past, the Monogatari series presents itself in an unique form of storytelling. The term ‘monogatari’ itself defines as literature. For a series based on storytelling to succeed though usually requires a character base with insightful plot, creative setting, descriptive ideas based on connections, and a strong literal sense of execution. Monogatari series plays on most of these concepts but constructs it like an experiment. Whether you dare to take on the experiment might have different experiences. However, there’s no doubt that this series and its franchise has tested their experiment and succeeded in their message. Indeed, the storytelling of Monogatari mixes itself with visual arts and dialogues. The strength of the series comes from its dialogues that creates humor, sense, and might evoke people’s minds to think its true meaning. Most of the time, the meaning of the dialogues are metaphoric and conveys to many ideas. Its usage of word plays presents its unique art style to attract viewers toward its messages. Through these messages, viewers will find out just how exclusive this shows’ storytelling separates itself from most forms of storytelling. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nMonogatari Series: Second Season isn’t just about storytelling though. As mentioned before, a strong character cast will attract viewers to almost any form of genre. Luckily, this show has plenty of that starring our Koyomi Araragi, a high school student whose life has changed forever after a certain incident. Obviously, I would assume that you have seen the original Bakemonogatari to understand this but Araragi makes his return in this sequel. He makes his presence well known as other characters in the series speculate him as many things - a lolicon, dangerous, pervert, just to name a few. However, we know that Araragi is a character of loyalty as seen through his relationship with Hitagi Senjougahara. More importantly though, he is also protective towards others including his friends, family, and even strangers. Some of his actions might be interpreted in the wrong way by other characters but the guy definitely has proven many times that he is the type that others can depend on. He seeks to achieve the endings that allows characters live in peace. However, this often puts a burden on himself as Araragi finds that sometimes, he can’t achieve everything alone. This even puts his own lives at risk many times. But hey, he is that type of that guy that takes risks. From a narrative perspective, his actions are often awarded although he doesn’t always takes everything for granted. Instead, he keeps his more of the ‘it’s the right thing to do’ attitude. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nMost of the supporting characters from the novels makes their appearances in the story arcs including Tsubasa Hanekawa, Mayoi Hachikuji, Suruga Kanbaru, Nadeko Sengoku, Shinobu Oshino, and Hitagi Senjougahara. All these characters plays their different roles that fulfills some sort of theme or morality to its title. Each of these titles present a different insight on our characters as we see a sort of journey to embark on. And of course, every journey begins with the first step. There’s already trouble in the beginning as we get a hint of supernatural madness going on. To make matters worse, Tsubasa herself finds trouble with her life as sudden changes occurs. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe first story arc initially reintroduces its narrative aspect to get viewers to familiarize themselves the format of how Monogatari works. Its supernatural themes takes on a more gruesome turn later on but there’s also hope and prosperity. As for the other arcs, each of them has a different theme and plot. Some of these arcs also explores the back stories of our supporting characters. Along with that, there’s character interactions that are dynamic with development. Additionally, each arc contains a similar style of storytelling through word plays, visual presentations, and dialogues. As the series contains supernatural elements as well, expect legends to unfold and discoveries to be made. These include spirit apparitions, vampires, mythic cats, and even Gods. The power of its dialogues enhances the experience with the power of its words. It’s an experience you won’t forget especially with some plot twists like one with a snake a girl.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nJudging on another level of the series is its humor. The style of Monogatari invokes humor in a sense that is quite peculiar. By peculiar though, I mean it as as a brilliant way because the show likes to experiment. Its stylish dialogues often mixes in parodies of other genres and themes for experimentation. These accompanied with the expressions of our characters creates a lavish theater of animation.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAs good as the series sounds, there’s a few aspects I found to be lacking. Namely, there’s perhaps a bit of too much fan service in the beginning that can be distracting. These don’t seem to have any meaning or dynamics and sometimes may distract viewers from the words play and dialogues. Other times, Araragi’s interactions with some of the other characters might even seem a bit creepy or hard to take for granted. This is especially true in one of the later arcs involving Shinobu that takes itself to a rather defiled way with their interactions. More importantly is the fact that the show sometimes likes to get a bit carried away with its conversations. Some of them might even drag on with small talk that can seem to be mundane. Other times, they flash way too fast to be read that can frustrate viewers in attempting to fully understanding its meaning. (if it has one at some occasions) Finally, there are some recap episodes between each story arc that drags the series together. They might help refresh a bit of its previous predecessors but can also be a waste of time for people who wants the series to accelerate itself. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nShaft handles the production of this series. You know what that means right? If extraordinary is a word that just popped into your mind, then you’re on the right track. By that term, Shaft is known to pull out a variety of series over the past year that have impacted the world. Names such as EF: A Fairy Tale of the Two, Arakawa Under the Bridge, Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei, and Puella Magi Madoka Magica are just a few that comes to mind. The artwork of Monogatari is in a sense that can be both visually attractive and descriptive the same time. When not presented as comedy, they hold a deeper meaning or metaphor behind them. Other times, they are connected to the dialogues spoken by the characters to convey their thoughts and feelings. Speaking of characters, most of them are designed in a similar way as their predecessors. Araragi still has that noticeable hair-like antenna sticking out of his head while his girlfriend still retains her haircut. Other characters like Shinobu, Nadeko, and Tsubasa all possesses artistic traits similar to their supernatural counterparts. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSoundtrack wise, the series maintains an eerie like atmosphere. During more of the climatic scenes, the series shifts its gears to a more dramatic tone with explosive entrances and executions. Other times, the series likes to keep its more balanced atmosphere along with comedic vibrations. The soundtrack might not be the most powerful device of the show but its various OP & ED songs makes up this department with its various styles. Almost every arc has a different song accompanied by the voice involving the star of that story. Similar to its word plays, they contain a pattern of artistic visuals to brings out the power of its orchestra. With its cast members also lies in the strength of their voices. Almost every characters demonstrates this with their voice mannerisms. These include the cunning Shinobu (Maaya Sakamoto), the kuudere Senjougahara (Chiwa Saito), innocent Nadeko (Kana Hanazawa), the mature Tsubasa (Yui Horie), the playful sisters of Karen and Tsukihi, and Araragi (Hiroshi Kamiya). Because the narrative aspect of the show is so strong with the dialogues, it is important to characterize each of their voices as a focus in order to bring out their best. And yes, I am grateful that these characters all bought forth their best thanks to the talents of their voice actor/actresses.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSo,this anime might not be for everyone. That’s something I’m sure most people have heard about the Monogatari franchise before. But if you pass this up for whatever reason, I still would recommend at least giving the first arc a try. That way, it might refresh a bit of experience of what you get out of the other series. However, I highly recommend watching this series only after you have completed its previous predecessors to gain full experience of its presentation. The Monogatari franchise has already achieved universal success thanks to its unique narrative, powerful dialogues, artistic word plays, and unique characters. Its humor will knock you out with high doses of laughter accompanied by its strange twist of stories. It even has bits of action too so violence is not out of the question there for fans looking for some intensity. (that and maybe its goal of achieving anemia with its fan service.) But all in all, Monogatarai series definitely took on the storytelling concept like never before creating an enjoyable experience. Now that is the ecstasy of success."

Well this is basically the same thing except it happens to almost every character in the entire show at least somewhere during the course of its progression.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBasically what happens is that since every arc is about resolving the problems of one of its many heroines, as soon as that arc is over she no longer has any role at all for the next arc. Bar a few exceptions, the only relevant characters at any point in time of the story are Araragi himself, Shinobu (because she’s stuck with him) and whichever girl who’s arc it currently is (and perhaps some antagonist-like character as well). The rest of the cast basically gets ignored completely, and this is not a small cast we’re talking about here, nor are the arcs all that short either. As a result, characters that might have appeared to be main characters at one point might completely disappear from the story for up to 20 episodes sometimes over the course of the seasons, (not discounting his supposed girlfriend) and that’s not exactly a small amount of time for this type of anime. Consequently, Araragi and Shinobu are the only characters that are given consistent character development over the course of the show, whereas everyone else has theirs completely halted every so often.",

It’s not like they’re actually gone, they just… temporarily disappear.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nNow I know part of this problem stems from the fact that the arcs of the Monogatari Series aren’t aired in the same order as they were written in the original Light Novels, and I understand that reading them might clear up a thing or two. However to me that is not really an excuse; an anime is its own product after all and should be able to deliver on consistent and easy-to-follow storytelling all on its own. You shouldn’t have to go read the source material just to get the full experience of the anime; they’re separate mediums for a reason after all.",

The animation is completely crazy and very much so up to interpretation but I think it looks absolutely beautiful at least. The soundtrack is not particularly memorable but it has its moments and is certainly not bad. And as far as the enjoyment value goes (which is what really matters in the end), I generally find it very inconsistent and spiky. There are some segments and dialogues in it that are simply brilliant, but just as often I find myself tapping my fingers on my desk in impatience for the series to actually get going.",

It just feels like there’s no clear goal regarding where the overarching story will end up and there are a lot of things to patch up and resolve before the eventual conclusion. I still think it can be done though and I hope the author can positively surprise me on this one, but as it currently stands I cannot make myself wholeheartedly approve of the direction this franchise has taken.",

At this point, it's hard to determine which approach is appropriate, as praising it would justify the decision MAPPA executives made and later encourage more situations like this for its staff, while criticizing it would discredit the effort of the staff, later proven by the cultural impact and media edits fans have posted for this season.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe two arcs this season adapts, Gojo's Past Arc and the infamous Shibuya Incident Arc that had many leaks and spoilers from manga fans; were surprisingly handled pretty well for something that was rushed. Well, since the Shibuya Incident Arc took a delay after Episode 5 aired, and for as little time they made to create 18 episodes fully compassing it, it did not disappoint, to say the least. The magnitude of the fights JJK is known for has multiplied further. Not to mention, we see some of the best voice acting to compete for 2023. Honestly, it was difficult to choose who had the best voice performance between Enoki Junya and Shimazaki Nobunaga, since they put their heart and soul into their roles, not to forget about Gojo's VA though. Truly the perfect example of everyone using 120% of their potential.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIf there's any actual criticism I could give for this anime, it's the storytelling. While the set pieces are pulled off really well, it's at the cost of some brainless plot conveniences. While the action sequences and the payoffs are great, the story's logic is idiosyncratic, like the previous season. It takes plenty of time to elaborate the power system and techniques used by different people alike, but then allows some characters to ignore that logic and then proceed to explain it in the most general way possible as if it would accomplish anything. This kind of shenanigans can be a real pain in the head for people who are looking for actual grounded shows. The author follows the system until they say that something needs to happen regardless of the outcome. Well, it just means you're going to see some plot armor here and there.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nOther than that, feast your eyes on some of the most action-packed sequences we have gotten this year. There are still some legitimate criticisms with people claiming the animation looks like fan art (they're not wrong, sometimes the art does look rough and unpolished), but the cinematography and choreography do not miss. It's so fluid that the impact of each of their force is properly registered and does not feel awkward (well, excluding a few scenes that took shortcuts like Episode 17). Taking into consideration the intensity and stakes this series has introduced further, the payoff is immensely satisfying, even greater than JJK Season 1's action sequences.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nTo summarize, Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 is a product of great talent that has been stretched thin by tight deadlines. We might never see a sequel of Jujutsu Kaisen that reaches this level of quality ever again, due to staff leaving MAPPA and never to be associated with it ever again. To me, it seems like the swan song of MAPPA's glory, as it all finally crumbles down for the people to see what lies beneath their facade."

Characters that are with us since a long time are still being neglected while new ones are being intruduced. Thanks to this problem author turns to a classic move of fleshing out a character right before his/her death, which I always hate to see, especially when they do it by having a long flashback. Antagonists are a very mixed bag. Sure Sukuna is great and I liked Mahito, but people like Toji or Geto are totally wasted which I will discuss in the spoiler section.",

In the whole prequel arc I didn't care at all about Geto, problem which would be easly fixed by placing said arc at the begging of the story. This would also make Jujutsu zero a much better story. Unfortunately while the first arc impressed me the most it wasn't free of flaws as the fall of Geto himself felt very rushed and didn't convince me at all. Toji also feels wasted, with his only contributions being a power up for Gojo and a push towards evil for a dead soon to be antagonist.",

This by all means shoud have been one of the best moments in this series. While we are talking about the big characters Kugisaki and Nanami turned out to have practically no arcs at all. Sure Nanami had his epic anime rage against some random, but I don't care. Nanami got basically abandoned by the author in favor of developing Itadori, which I despise as a decision. To be honest woman in this show have always been disappointing either being just a variation of your typical smirki personality or underdeveloped and forgettable like the blue haired Gojo fangirl. While we talk about Gojo I also have to say that I really don't get the hype about the most prideful and unchanging character in this series, but that is me just ranting at this point.",

When it first hit the mainstream anime community in 2020, many immediately took to praising it as one of the best Battle Shonens to come out of modern Jump, in spite of the fact that, in many other people’s eyes, it had yet to do anything all that notable or special to set itself apart from the competition. A big part of this was, of course, manga readers hyping up what the series would eventually do later down the line, and\n                  ",

            "\r\nRegardless of the reason behind the hype, it was undeniable to many people that the show had potential. Sure, it might not be anything too special now, many people said, but if it executes its ideas well and lives up to the expectations the Manga readers set, then it absolutely could become one of the best modern Shonens.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAnd that’s where this season comes in. Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 is the series’s attempt to cash in all its hype, the moment where shit hits the fan and it truly becomes the series everyone says it could be. Or rather, to put it more accurately, Season 2 is when the show *tries* to do that, but ends up failing, falling down several flights of stairs, and ruining most of what made it entertaining in the first place.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBreaking it down first, it’s almost necessary to talk about the season in terms of the two parts which it was broken up into: the 6 episode Hidden Inventory arc which constitutes the start, and the 17 episode Shibuya Incident arc which makes up the remainder of the season.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe Hidden Inventory arc isn’t exactly anything too special, but it’s easily the best part of the season. This is some of the most tightly focused and plotted writing in the series, with its relatively short episode count being well-complemented by its small cast. As a flashback arc detailing Gojo’s Past, it succeeds well enough, adding a layer of nuance to the character which expands on what had been previously hinted at regarding him. It retains the first season’s sense of goofy charm while managing to be relatively more serious, and is generally rather well-directed and animated on top of that.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThis isn’t to say that it’s perfect, of course. The last stretch of the arc especially shows signs of rushing as just 5 episodes isn’t quite enough to fit the many emotional beats the arc tries to hit, leading to several parts of it falling rather flat when it comes to elements which don’t deal directly with Gojo’s character arc.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nNow you might be thinking at this point that this seems rather more positive and good than I was making it out to be at the start of this review. Well, that’s because the real problems with the season come in its second, much larger part, the Shibuya Incident.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nShibuya starts out fine enough, mostly in how it picks up the momentum from the Hidden Inventory arc to fuel its first major fight and kick off the events of the arc. However, this is immediately lessened by the fact that that fight then proceeds to negate half of the emotional core of the Hidden Inventory arc in the first place, retroactively ruining a perfectly good arc for the sake of a cheap shock value reveal.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThis bit of less than stellar writing is then followed by the onset of the rest of the arc, which is practically a nonstop series of fight scenes. And here’s where a huge problem rears its head: most of them don’t really matter.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nFirstly, the show’s rather lean worldbuilding becomes a detriment here. The Jujutsu World as it exists is essentially a vague sketch made up of generic shonen worldbuilding tropes which the audience has no investment in. This was fine in the first season, where the stakes were generally character-based and the overall world took a backseat, but as Shibuya’s stakes are inherently grounded in the series’s setting, this starts to become a detriment to the audience’s investment.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThis would also likely be fine if the character writing within the arc was competent enough to carry the series like it did in the first season. However, here we come to another problem: the character writing in Shibuya takes an utter nosedive. This problem is rather multifaceted, so let’s break it down a bit.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nFirstly, the fights don’t really progress anything meaningful regarding the characters. Half of the fights in this season are against random one-note mooks whose only notable feature is their special ability. Consequently, there’s no personal stakes involved for any of the characters, and they have little-to-no development coming out of them. This arc’s episode count could be cut in half and pretty much nothing would change considering how inconsequential most of the fights are. This isn’t helped by the insane cast bloat, as the show constantly throws even more underdeveloped, one-note characters at the viewer and hopes that they might care about at least one of them.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSecondly, the series’ fights lack any sort of flair or personality. A big part of the appeal of the show’s first season was how simply fun the cast was in terms of their interactions and how their lovably distinct personalities shined through in their fights. However, as this is the “serious” arc, characters are not allowed to show personality or any interesting unique characteristics while fighting. So instead we get an indistinct gray sludge of generic, forgettable fight after generic, forgettable fight which is lacking in both style and substance, carried only by the efforts of the animators.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nHow does a writer keep the audience engaged in such an aggressively uninteresting slog, you ask? It’s quite simple, really: cheap shock value! You see that character the audience generally likes? Arbitrarily kill them off! Sure, their potential as a character hasn’t even begun to be tapped into and the audience barely knows them since you’ve spent so little time actually developing them, but if you make it sudden enough, you might be able to deceive the viewer into thinking it’s good writing!",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nOh, what’s that? The viewer isn’t quite emotional yet? Just shove a flashback in the middle of their death scene and spend half the episode on it! Shoving all the character’s actual depth into the very end of their screen time, literally right before they’re dead, is *totally* a legitimate substitute for writing an actually compelling character. And, just to make sure the audience gets the point, give the character *another* flashback at the start of the next episode, just beat the audience over the head with what they’re supposed to be feeling, that’ll totally make them think the show is actually emotionally meaningful and not just boring crap.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nRepeat some variant of this formula a couple times over, and you’ve got yourself the Shibuya Incident experience!",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nNow, of course, some might say that even if the show isn’t well-written in the slightest, it’s still very well-animated, so you can just enjoy it as turn-your-brain-off fun. However, even that approach has its problems due to the series’s consistency issues. For every genuinely great-looking fight, there’s another that’s ruined by flat shading, messy storyboarding, and the show’s ludicrously boring color palette. And even if you can look beyond that, the show’s attempts to shove emotions down your throat consistently ruin any attempt you might make to turn your brain off. It’s rather hard to just take in the action sakuga when half the episode is taken up by a boring flashback.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nOverall, Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 can best be summed up in one word: Edgy. The season discards all of the potential it once had in favor of an “I’m 14 and this is deep” experience where an incoherent combination of black & red color palettes, random horrific imagery, and arbitrarily killing off characters passes itself off as good storytelling. It’s the most disappointing direction the series could have possibly taken, and easily one of the worst anime experiences of the year. Unless you’re an edgy teenager or a rabid sakuga fanatic, avoid this season like the plague."

Or when Qiang Lei explains how she thinks babies are made (because these characters share the minds of children, not adults…). Many of the characters look like actual clowns, like Wang Qi. Others have rabbit teeth and bizarre hairstyles. Why? Is this supposed to be a kids show? Lucky for the writers, they have amazing reference material, but their ability to write dialogue can sometimes be god damn awful and lacks maturity. An intriguing character like Li Mu, who in my opinion, is neither good nor evil, is better defined by his actions, which explain his motives and character far better than his dialogue does... I imagine if we got better dialogue, many of the interesting characters in this show would become even more incredible.

There are two things that you can think about that scene, either a fanservice or an easter egg from the ending of the movie. But let’s not talk about that and move forward. The members of the gang from the elite student council are back! But there’s one problem, Kaguya suffered from an identity crisis! I like the part when they thought about the kiss because it’s merely an unanswered question of mine. What is the meaning of that kiss? What were Kaguya’s intentions at that time? What will be their relationship from now on? The first act was cute when they adapted the chibi Kaguya while she still had THAT attitude to Ishigami. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe pacing was so fine like they reduced the comedic moments and focused on the romance between the two main characters. It made me feel the pure romantic vibe of the story, rather than being a satire from the previous season. They removed some unnecessary scenes from the manga but it doesn’t feel rushed when I watched it. Yes, there are still comedic moments from the other characters and Shirogane himself. His expressions are so funny when he overthinks things around him, especially to Kaguya. The other characters had some moments but I’ll focus on the main storyline about the two, and how did I like their other sides of the story so far.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\n- Spoilers –",
            "\r\nThis is the part that I love the most. How did they deal their themselves at this moment? After the meeting of Kaguya’s personas, it is revealed that the original, or the ice-cold one is the one who truly loves Shirogane the most. While Shirogane, the perfect one, conceals his true self to stand by her side. This is one of the most realistic approaches in many relationships. People know that to be liked by someone is to prove our worth. You must be a perfect person. You must conceal yourself and replace a self where that person can accept you. That’s the cruel part. We might end up having an identity crisis and find it difficult to find our true selves from the many selves that we made. I like the part when Kaguya’s original self enters the whole scene and shows her true self to her, while she’s scared because she might hurt Shirogane. She distanced herself from all the people around her because of her family name and nature. She isn’t really angry but the people around were angry at her. But the reason why she did that was that she didn’t want to end up hurting people. She also thought that when she was finally in love with Shirogane so she built an idiotic self and the current self from the previous seasons, in order not to hate her. So this time, she suppressed her other self because she just don’t want to be an idiot and be carried away, but she want to think about what will happen in the future. She wanted a normal life as a normal young girl. Same for Shirogane, to like and impress by Kaguya, he worked his ass off to become perfect. He poured almost his time to become perfect not just for her, but for other people. He only wanted to notice by Kaguya and the whole student body. But he realizes that it’s not his true self, but “a perfect self” that he made. Being nasty, spineless, a piece of trash, talentless, and a coward are his true self. He fears that everything is over the moment he shows any signs of weakness. He thought that there was no way that Kaguya is destined to be with him because she was just too perfect to reach.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIn this part, they are scared of revealing who they are. They both had reasons for why they concealed themselves, and not showing all of it to each other. Their weaknesses and negative sides of themselves. But being who they are and showing who they are is one of the important key factors in having a romantic relationship. Accepting not only the good sides but also the flaws and imperfections that each other. And even, though everyone isn’t perfect you should embrace also your flaws and other selves to understand yourself.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe Christmas party in the last part is one of my favorite moments in the whole story. There are funny moments like the gift revealing that made me laugh. The Handmade Bombs gift is the weirdest and it’s funny because they executed it well. The bench part is the most romantic scene I’ve ever discovered. They confronted each other and revealed their true selves. Kaguya wants to know if Shirogane hates her true self, while Shirogane still hides it from the girl he loves. Kaguya being determined to show her true self marks her finest character development because she had nothing to fear, even though she carries her prideful family name. She gets his gift, and it was revealed that his gift was just a cheap toy. I didn’t expect that reaction from Shirogane when he was asked about his gift. In the end, she gratefully accepts it and his true self. They shared a romantic kiss under a half-moon. Not an ultra-romantic full moon, but still romantic.  ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThere are many messages from this movie that I appreciated. It’s fine not to be perfect. Love doesn’t have to be perfect like making grand surprises, saying great lines, improving themselves just to be perfect, and even having a kiss in a romantic scene. There’s nothing more wonderful than sharing everything and completely understanding one another. Showing the plain normal self and people who are closest to us will embrace who we are. Having closure for these two characters made me feel romantic and somehow wanted to cheer them on their romantic journey.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe animation and music are amazing so far and the adaptation is well done. As expected from A-1 Pictures, they gave me reasons why this studio will remain my favorite. The theme Love is Show made it to my second favorite song from the whole Kaguya-sama. It is not catchy but it’s lively and lovely. The seiyuus did a very good job of voicing the characters. The background music from this movie skyrocketed my impressions and they were made a great job with it. Probably my favorite soundtrack so far.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nOverall, this movie is a sweet treat for all Kaguya-sama fans. The movie gave justice to the manga, and it made one of my favorite romance movies. It made me believe again that romance stories are still a thing, after the disastrous adaptation/ending of 5-toubun no Hanayome. It is marked on my list as the pinnacle of romance from the whole Kaguya-sama story, and I hope that this marks the conclusion of the main storyline. The next stories from the manga felt flat actually but who knows? A-1 Pictures might start milking the cash cow.",

This movie follows the classical narrative structure in three acts, but where it fails to me is in its third: I don't feel like I witnessed much progression for any situation that was left pending in Season 3. Only one character has been developed (which they badly needed, so props for that) but that is it. My biggest issue with this arc lies in the fact that the movie created a problem that didn't exist in the first three seasons, only to resolve it and come back to where we left the whole cast at the end of season 3.

Episodic version of this movie is somewhat bearable, even if it feels so much like a set of four special episodes, serving as an extension of the previous season. But hey, this version was created later, no? If I decide to review a movie, I need to treat it as such, because the show that's being reviewed was intended at first to be experienced in that particular format.

That's true, however, TV series already looked alright and all previous seasons were mostly carried by fancy direction and vibrant colours used in the art style.

Yes, I know these elements appear in Seasons 1-3 as well, but at least they present bigger variety and hmm... mature? I think it's a good way to word it.

Too bad my expectations weren't met, and I think that as long as you are not a devoted fan of this series, your experience has rather a huge chance to be most likely similar. Maybe a little better, maybe a little worse, but still underwhelming by a huge margin. With having everything written earlier in mind, I just can't recommend it. Not for people who are not devoted fans of this franchise, or who simply wanted to see a cute movie sequel to a series they were once watching. That being said, if you are already a huge fan of this franchise, dear reader, which is of course fine, then I think there's a huge chance that you're gonna actually like it. No matter whether you will decide to watch it in the original, movie format, or in the episodic one. Sadly, I'm not a huge fan of Kaguya-sama series. Not a hater as well. I'm just a regular enjoyer of this series. And I just wanted to see a good movie."

            "\r\nIf you told me a couple of years ago that an anime franchise involving high school sports would become one of my favorites in the medium, I probably would've laughed in your face. But I've come to realize that the quality of an anime goes beyond how it makes you think. How it makes you feel is just as important... because at the end of the day, most of us watch anime as a means to escape the repetition of everyday life and just enjoy ourselves. It transports us somewhere exciting, somewhere we normally don’t experience ourselves. Anime should be fun, and Haikyuu is no exception to that. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nHaikyuu's third season could almost be viewed as an expansion pack to the main series, or as one reviewer put it, much like DLC for your favorite video game. This is a fair assessment given the truncated 10 episodes compared to the first two seasons of 26 episodes each. Karasuno finds themselves pitted against the powerhouse Shiratorizawa, in a 5 set match no one expects them to win. There is less character development overall, but more than enough action to make up for it. I’d say this season emulates the intense tone produced by the last few episodes in season 2, my favorites of the entire series. The result is a nail-biting, pulse-pounding thrill ride to the match's epic conclusion. It's just what I needed to get me through a relatively lackluster fall season. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThere isn’t much in the way of story this season, due mostly to its shorter run time. Being in a 5 set match is unfamiliar territory for our favorite Karasuno team, which begins to show as the series progresses. Exhaustion starts to become a factor, and for the first time I can remember in Haikyuu, players begin to tire mentally and physically. This incorporates an important aspect of playing sports, making the characters that much more relatable to someone who’s been there. We also see a culmination of the variety of new skills Karasuno’s players have been practicing come to fruition when they matter the most. Whether from Nishinora’s jump-setting or Tsukishima’s read-blocking, each player plays a pivotal role in turning the tides at one or more points during the match. The writers of Haiykuu also continue their emphasis on the backgrounds of Karasuno’s opponents throughout the match. It was a tad watered down from last season, and I would still have liked to see Ushijima’s past elaborated on more. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the whole series up to this point is the sudden mental involvement displayed by none other than the deadpan Tsukishima. Normally Tsuki exhibits a personality as dynamic as a cardboard box, but shocks us all as he begins to become more engaged and driven to help out his team. He emulates the mentality that no one likes to lose, and I found myself actually cheering out loud for him when he blocked Ushijima for the first time. Another refreshing point to bring up about the cast is how passive a role Hinata and Kageyama actually play in this season. As the series progresses, the narrative shifts from the drive and determination of Hinata as an individual to the importance of teamwork and synergy. The result is truly powerful and I’ve begun to really get attached to every member of Karasuno’s team. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nObviously the hype in Haikyuu is beyond unreal, and the third season is the best example of this. Even the relatively stone-faced members of Shiratorizawa get wrapped up in the excitement. Anime has proven time and time again that you can breathe life and intensity into any subject matter. Some people may fault the series for its plethora of overreactions and such, but at this point the viewer should come to expect it based on the precedent laid out by Haikyuu’s first two seasons. It’s the necessary evil of sports anime, but one I have grown to forgive Haikyuu for because I love it the series that much. Even up until the last episode, the result of the match was unclear and allowed me to stay glued to my screen for the entire 10 episodes. Karasuno doesn’t always win, and that vulnerability makes you cheer for them even harder when they do. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIs it better than Season 2? Unfortunately, the abridged format coupled with less interesting characters cause it to fall short of the brilliance surrounding the second installment. Many of the training camp episodes from last season did more to add to the story than I realized, causing viewers to really bond with the opposing players that much more. Not to mention Oikawa being the character you wanted to cheer for but couldn’t. Another aspect of the series I didn’t find to be irritating until this point was the lack of family members from Karasuno’s players being shown in the stands. Instead we are limited to a select few that are grouped together while the rest of the crowd seems to consist of the student body. From attending many high school sporting events in the past, it can be somewhat hard to fathom how the parents of these kids aren’t even in the picture in their matches. A small complaint, but one I just don’t understand. Maybe Furudate (creator) though Haikyuu had enough characters already! ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nVoice acting is still solid and the music is consistently upbeat and powerful. There are quite a few recycled tracks from the earlier seasons, which I actually found comforting more than stale for the series. The sound editing and effects are some of the best in the business, as Haikyuu delivers again with its realistic gymnasium sounds and crowd noises. The animation also seems like it received a significant upgrade from the show’s debut season, rivaling other sports series like Ping Pong in its level of “over-the-top-ness”.. Granted, only having to edit together one setting for the entire season probably allowed the animation team to expand their skills in other, more intricate areas. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nTo sum up this season in one sentence (as recommended by one of my MAL pals), Haikyuu S3 is “A white-knuckled underdog story driving 100 mph over the speed limit, wearing a huge grin the entire time.” It’s a series best viewed in one binge-watching session rather than enjoyed week by week, and is only bested by it’s previous installment. If you’ve seen the first two seasons, you’re already behind the curve by not picking this one up... it’s a hell of a good time!

            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSo with all that out of the way let's talk about season 3 of Haikyuu!! So Haikyuu season 3 is basically just one volleybal match in the course of 10 episodes between Karasuno (the team you are supposed to root for) and Shiratorizawa. And yes the match is 10 episodes long. And keep in mind that most of the important matches in haikyuu are roughly 4-6 episodes long. So you know what that means. Desperately stretching the running time so it will meet the ten episode mark. Because of this the anime felt like a chore to watch through.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe pacing in Haikyuu!! has never been that great. Sometimes it could be confusing to see what the standings were between the teams because there are not a lot of opportunities to cut to them. And somehow this season managed to mess that even more up by constantly slowing down the match for extra running time.  This was done by using unnecessary flashbacks, constantly cutting to the coaches or the crowd who'll fill up screen time for the next three minutes (you're going to see that cliché a lot). They also achieve this by having some filler. One particular character gets a lot more screentime than the rest of his teammates. And apparently he didn't get that screen time in the manga (that's what I've heard correct me if I'm wrong). Even though a lot of people liked it, I've felt like it was something that should've been done at the end of season 2 at best. It would've worked with Aoba Jousai because they're technically their rivals not with Shiratorizawa because they were just a powerhouse that they needed to defeat and not their long life rivals (even though the anime acted like they were).",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSpeaking of Shiratorizawa that's another bad thing of this season. Shiratorizawa was very very bland and boring. They're your stereotypical bad guy team who think that the underdogs are not worthy of their time, but when they actually start playing they suddenly realise that the underdogs are good etc etc. I won't say that the opposing teams in Haikyuu!! are very rich and deep in character because that's basically not true. However there was something which made each team at the very least acceptable and not annoying to watch. Every team who faced Karasuno never thought little of them. Yes they mocked Hinata sometimes but the team as a whole were taken serious as soon as the match started. Even their rival, Aoba Jousai, did this. And the fact that Shiratorizawa is your stereotypical bad guy made this match more annoying to watch.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nNow let's talk about animation quality. The redeeming quality of the anime for probably most people. And even though the animation is very good, I mean the animations themselves are very nicely done with great details and the 3d environments was well used and were not distracting. However I do want to note that a lot of earlier used shots are reused in the anime. And some of them can be forgiven, but some of the more impressive shots were repeated which takes away the magic that those shots gave when you first saw them. It seems very desperate to lower the production costs. And this is a problem that seasons 1 and 2 also have. But because this season is so unnecessarily long this stuff stands out more than usual. Not to mention that in a lot of flashbacks older shots from previous seasons were used too.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe sound of Haikyuu!! is nothing special. It's your average sports anime music. There is nothing wrong with it but it's also not the most amazing soundtrack you'll ever hear.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSo what is haikyuu season 3? I would say it's a huge disappointment and could potentially be bad for the industry if this is accepted by a large amount of people. I won't say that I completely hated it. There were some moments that I did enjoy. And the animation quality is still good even though a lot of animations were repeated a lot. But those few moments that I enjoyed won't justify everything wrong with this season of Haikyuu!! And in my honest opinion it deserves a low score. Hype can't fix something like this. And if you somehow managed to read through all of this stuff and not looked at the score I have given this season and immediately hate me and disagree with me, well congrats.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nI would not recommend Haikyuu!!: Karasuno Koukou VS Shiratorizawa Gakuen Koukou to your average anime fan. If you want to watch the Haikyuu!! series I would say watch season 1 and 2 and read some spoilers online so that you would avoid this and wait for the real season 3. The only people that would probably like this are die hard haikyuu fans."

Most of his music is quite subdued in nature and takes a careful ear to notice when your eyes are being captivated by what's going on in the screen, but do take notice if you have the chance. Or search on YouTube for videos of his live performances. His music is a joy to listen to. Like with Spirited Away, Hisaishi's music lacks all the &quot;bells and whistles&quot; per se, but it's beauty lies in its simplicity. Hisaishi has not failed here in Spirited Away.",

Haku steals a trinket from Yubaba's sister for a reason that's both not fully explained and ultimately irrelevant.

Chihiro forgets her name but then sees it on a card and remembers it again.  Haku makes a big deal about how she needs to hang onto that card so she'll always remember...and then it's never touched on again.

Ok, perfectly normal but what gets me is when they see an abandon building they decided to go in and explore.  Next, they go, &ldquo;oh look food that&rsquo;s sitting out with no-one around&rdquo; let eat.  The events leading up to Chihiro getting trapped in the fantasy world are way too plot devicy for my taste.  However, this isn&rsquo;t my main complaint about the film, it&rsquo;s just that the rest is so shallow I can&rsquo;t really analyze it with much depth.  The rest of the story can be summarized by Chihiro get a jobs, does a job, returns something, get freed and goes home.

What I think Spirited Away tries to do is create a magical world in which the viewer can escape to.  It tries to take us on an adventure to somewhere very different.  That is does, studio Ghibli creates a worlds that is both imaginative and beautiful.  I could go on and on about the world but words wouldn&rsquo;t do it justice.  However, something is very wrong when the only major praise I can give is about the fantasy world that is created.  They spend way too much time creating and focusing on this world.  When I analyze a few scenes I realize how drawn out Spirited Away makes each scene.  They could have easily cut 30-40 minutes and have a more focused story.  This is how they were able to stretch such a thin plot out for 2 hours.",

Sadly the characters don&rsquo;t fare too much better.  Chihiro does grow over the course of the movie and in the end she is a bit stronger and can now face new challenges (i.e. new school, neighborhood, etc).  After going through what she went through, I don&rsquo;t think a new school will faze her.  However, there really isn&rsquo;t much to Chihiro&rsquo;s character, she&rsquo;s simply a random girl that happens to go on an inadvertent adventure and becomes a little bit stronger in the end.  She feels a bit like an empty shell for the audience to live through.  In general, the characterization for the movie feels a bit weak, I mean do we really know these characters?  If that&rsquo;s all there is to these characters, then I have no choice but to conclude that most of them are extremely flat.  ",

This is studio Ghibli and Spirited Away is also a movie so there should be no excuses when it comes to animation.  The environments are beautiful and quite vibrant.  Characters designs are extremely consistent but I don&rsquo;t like the designs that Studio Ghibli uses.  Not really a negative, just a personal preference.  Music, really works to create and accent the magical world of Spirited Away.   However, the music is nothing too note worthy, above average I guess.  In contrast, the voice work, this is a meh for me in both the English and Japanese, nothing really outstanding or bad.

Thankfully, these themes and ideas never become the focus or become too blatant.  Also, I have to add another audience that Spirited Away may have been targeted to.  That would be nostalgic Japanese adults that long for a more traditional setting away from the modern world.  In that respects it does a great job however, I&rsquo;m neither a child nor a Japanese adult disillusioned with the modern world.  So it should be no surprise that I&rsquo;m not very fond of this film, as none of the positives really appeal to me.  Those would be the imaginative/magical or nostalgic world of Spirited Away.",

Even now after watching it a few hours ago I&rsquo;m having a hard time remembering the details."

            "is stunning, the direction is phenomenal and the voice acting is as good, if not even better than the first season. It’s noticeable that a lot of care and effort has been put into making Mob Psycho 2. But despite all of these amazing features it has, I feel as if Mob Psycho has lost what made it unique and fun. What made the first season of Mob psycho great in my opinion is three points: the lightheartedness, the sense of humor and the characters. Season 2 only hits one of these points, but actually improves upon it. The characters. Mob and friends have never been better. Mob actually has an arc spanning over the whole season, not one forced into the last few episodes (as in season 1). Mob wants to improve as a person and actively makes an effort to do so. Something you really can’t say he does in the first season. Reigen also has an amazing arc this season. I won’t talk much about it because it would be a shame if I spoiled it for someone. Reigen was more or less the same person at the end of the first season as he was at the start. In season 2 tho, he’s a changed man at the end. It’s not only Mob and Reigen that’s gotten better, but all other characters also stepped up in season 2. They all changed so much that some felt out of character. But I don’t mind since the most of the characters are very well written. And that’s the part of Mob I adore. The rest of it kind of sucks.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe two other points that season 2 doesn’t get is the lightheartedness and humor. Which mostly goes hand in hand. Mob psycho season 1 is a lighthearted slice of life anime about a boy with psychic powers that despite his lack of emotion tries to live out his normal life as good as possible. Mob psycho season 1 never gets serious and dark. It has its emotional moments but never something too serious. In season 2 mob literally comes home to find his house on fire and sees what he believes to be his family burning. Mob Psycho 2 is one of the darkest and most serious shows I’ve seen in a while. And I don’t understand why, Mob Psycho was funny because of how lightheartedly these situation that would be handled totally different in other shows. That’s why it’s funny. When the most serious thing ever happen and Reigen then laughs about it later isn’t funny. It seems more like a flaw in Reigens character. I feel weird saying this but Mob Psycho season 2 isn’t funny at all.  Season 2 abandons the concept of the first season and it makes me really disappointed. The first season of Mob Psycho was an analysis of manchildren and more or less a parody of shounen animes. But the second season isn't a parody anymore. It’s turned into what it made fun of in the first place. I find it very hard to even call it a slice of life anymore. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nTo further prove my point that Mob psycho isn’t a slice of life anymore is the frequency and lengths of fights. There are few fights in the first season of Mob, meaning that when Mob went 100% and the fights broke out, it felt Impactful and epic. But in season 2 there are fights more or less every episode. The fights are longer, some spanning over something like 10 minutes. The animation might be great, but it gets overwhelming. I was finding myself sighing and thinking isn’t this fight over soon? Rather than being amazed by them as I was in season 1.",
            "\r\nThe most stupid thing ever happened as well. You know how the show is called Mob Psycho 100. Well suddenly mobs emotions can get ever 100% and he grew even more powerful. The point of the WHOLE show is that once the emotions get to 100% they overflow and Mob can’t control them anymore. But what’s the point of that if he suddenly can get 200%. It breaks the concept season 1 put up.  Season 2 takes everything season 1 does good and throws it in the trash can. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nWhat was once fresh and amazing is now just another My Hero Academia, and it’s a real shame. I had high hopes for this anime and I was let down big time. I would honestly rather watch the worst anime ever than rewatch this. The animes I feel the least from are the ones that are mediocre, the animes with extreme wasted potential. And Mob Psycho has sadly become one of them. I was expecting greatness and when what I got was very mediocre. It hit hard and my rating off this season of Mob Psycho suffered."

We are introduced to more characters including new allies, enemies, and Nightmare Frames. As the series progresses new factions are introduced and new alliances formed, with plot twists abound. The plot twists in R2 are even more abundant, and at times even more implausible and unexpected than the first season, with every episode essentially ending in a cliffhanger. However, the characters this time around are far more likable, even if they are so numerous that many of them, unfortunately, end up being underdeveloped. And while the show starts off slow, the plot eventually moves forward very fast and while stumbles somewhat near the climax, manages to pull off a remarkably well-crafted resolution at the end. Fans who were disappointed by the way the first season ended will undoubtedly be satisfied with the bizarre ending of R2.",

Now to be clear, by no means is this a primary focus of R2, however, the actions and motivations of the characters and the events themselves seem to have greater meaning and purpose. The range of emotions felt by the characters is better conveyed: we feel their desperation and determination, their sadness and joy, their anger and regret. Characters that seemed so empty or clichéd in the first season are given greater depth and expression, with exceptions of course. Lelouch, in particular, is a far more interesting character this time around, and his inner conflict and desire for self-resolution. He'll do things that you wouldn't expect him to do. Also, his changing relationships with his comrades and enemies alike act as a drive that propels the show from a mere continuation into a rejuvenation of the series. Lelouch fans will definitely find him more interesting and amazing as well as the other characters. Especially Kallen.",

The visuals of R2 are not just better than the original, but are also some/one of the best I've seen (though somewhat expected considering them using an extraordinary amount of budget.) R2 is definitely more flashier and colorful than ever before, the high quality of the visuals consistently impresses from one episode to the next. The characters and backgrounds are incredibly detailed and the large-scale action sequences are spectacular to watch. The only gripe I have is that the animation itself often lacks fluidity, especially during some of the more hectic action sequences. This didn't really take much away from the actual quality of the visuals but it is rather noticeable nevertheless. Actually, with the action and everything going on, you won't even notice the lack of fluidity. And while SUNRISE doesn't quite stand at the absolute top-tier level in terms of overall animation quality, R2 represents their best work since their old age of shows like Cowboy Bebop. In terms of the animation, Code Geass R2 sure have one of the best this year.",

The music, on the other hand, is more of a mixed bag. The soundtrack itself is solid, a score that is well suited for the mixture of tones that a series like Geass goes through. The theme songs, conversely, are merely mediocre and all but one remains memorable. The pop theme surely is one of my favorite having listen to the songs many times.",

While its approach is often divergent from the first, it shares enough absurdities and overindulgence that those who didn't like the first series will most likely detest this one. Yet for all its flashiness, its superficiality and its dangerously complex back-story, this is still a far more entertaining series than most of the other shows out there. Again, Code Geass R2 proves that entertainment doesn't always have to be meaningful, just enjoyable. If you didn't enjoy the first season, then you most likely will not enjoy R2."

Instead we get the genius Lelouch running around in meaningless fanservice episodes and battling characters with sorcerer's eyes. Remember how in season 1, the story revolved around interesting characters in a semi-realistic war in an alternate timeline of Earth? Ha. That much time into this season and the most important and game-changing thing you'll see is a C.C. upskirt. Then halfway through it meanders around some outlandish garbage in a plot entirely about two characters that for all intents and purposes died in the first season. Hell, the middle section of the show is so tacked on and meaningless I honestly can't comprehend why it was ever there to begin with. Finally, for the last half of the series the story turns at a 90 degree angle by the end of each and every episode. Lots of completely pointless and boring battles happen near the end, but it doesn't matter since the circumstances don't make much sense, no sane viewer has any emotion invested in the characters fighting, and the battle tactics that were once the high point of the series are now something you'd find Zapp Brannigan doing. This amazing torrent of plot holes, bad pacing and meaningless events reaches its climax in a contrived copout that probably wouldn't have even been that bad if the rest of the story were consistent.

Or their character is moronic. Or their main purpose is to pander to a certain sect of otaku. Or they're just boring. Or they serve no established purpose in the series at all. If someone can comment on my profile and explain why Gino, Xing Ke and Jeremiah were in this show(Crispin Freeman shouting LOYALTY is not a valid excuse for Jeremiah. Even Crispin himself doesn't know why that guy exists or is popular), that would be dandy.",

Out of CGR2's enormous cast of about 40 recurring characters, only three are anywhere near being decent. You'd think C.C. would be on this brief listing, but she doesn't exist for half of the series and as soon as she shows up her character is completely rewritten after her only story-relevant sequence.

That might've been intentional, but I'm not entirely buying it. Even so, Lelouch's character is boring, his motivations change constantly and all of his \"intelligence\" from the first season has been relegated into performing \"miracles\"(cheap/contrived/ridiculous plot twists) and sending in waves of dudes to clog the enemies' cannons. His master plan and endgame strategy seemed genius enough to thousands of idiots across the internet to give him incredible praise, but it really was just as much of a joke as the rest of his iceberg summoning and floor collapsing  antics. Think Watchmen, if it were written by a 12 year old.",

He spends a lot of his time angry over what happened at the end of last season and struggling over his tool-ish idealism. In fact, all this guy does is angst about Lelouch for a majority of the time he's around. This one time he was told to protect someone, but she wandered off and died. So Suzy blamed Lelouch, because that's how he rolls. He's basically Kira Yamato with a bipolar personality and even more immortality. Suzaku's actually a rather unlikable character and his personality swings around like a pendulum, but that's about as good as it gets in this series.",

His character, despite being introduced solely as yaoi fanservice in Suzaku's absence, is the most consistent and well written in the series by a good distance. He develops, never contradicts his purpose, and was a key point in one of the most memorable and non-idiotic scenes. Ultimately Rolo was totally unimportant, almost as if the writers set him on a shelf next to the series so he didn't get covered in the sticky, smelly substance it was leaking all over the place. So sad.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe final aspect of this tripe I'm going to talk about in detail is the focus. Code Geass has none. What is Code Geass about, in the end? What is its genre? Who is it marketed to? Respectively, those answers are: Nothing, All of them, and Everyone. The only unifying thing in Code Geass is Lelouch's character, but he isn't a good character. He's not as interesting as Light Yagami in terms of personality or his goals and he's not as well written as someone like Kenzou Tenma. So really, all you have is an entire story centered around this barely-above-shounen-writing guy with no prominent driving themes, commentary or anything like that.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nCode Geass also attempts, and apparently succeeded, in appealing to every kind of anime fan. The series was fairly consistent and balanced during its first season, but the follow-up did nothing but shine spotlights all over its cliches and pandering features. The character designs become more fanservicey and CLAMP-y, drawing in boys and girls. The robots suddenly evolve from bipedal tanks to laser-spamming, transforming, energy shield-bearing monstrosities. The genre fluctuates between melodrama, politics, comedy, fantasy, romance, science fiction, psychological thriller, school stories and what have you depending on the episode. It just doesn't work. Taniguchi and the writers had no interest in being original or telling a cohesive story here and instead set their eyes on making tons of cash for Sunrise. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBut yeah, the animation on the DVD versions are pretty good and the soundtrack is by one of the better guys in the business. At face value, Code Geass isn't a bad series. It's mindlessly entertaining, but the issue here is that so, so many think it's anything more than that, which does a disservice to people who watch good, original and well crafted Japanese animation and to the industry as a whole."

More importantly, one of the primary objectives in the early stages of this season is to prevent Eren making contact with Zeke. As you expect, the first episode begins as a chaotic warfare involving soldiers, warriors, and Titans.

Adapted out of the manga, 'The Rumbling' is an extraordinary event taking place this season. It chronicles a dark and grim reality for all life that concerns with the Marley and Eldians. While this season doesn't adapt The Rumbling at its fullest, it does bring in many questions for the anime only audience. Will anyone be able to stop The Rumbling? Who will live and who will die? What will be the ultimate outcome of Eren's plan in the end? Sadly, those questions won't have their full answers this season.

It's a pivotal moment to show that the past has not been forgotten. Jean has changed so much from his rookie years as a survey corps member to a loyal soldier fighting for his cause. Knowing the truth hurt him but he also realized what must be done for the greater good. Furthermore, we are also reintroduced to another prominent character from the Warrior Unit.

The episodes later this season highlights how far they'll go to push their plan even it means killing whoever stands in their way. And that is a common theme about Attack on Titan. There's bloodshed and death, where sacrifices are needed for a greater cause. Eren's goal is perhaps the most controversial for he puts entire mankind and the ecosystem at risk.

            "\n        No amount of memes or social media posts could ever make me hate Solo Leveling. No, Solo Leveling doesn’t have the strongest story, yes Jinwoo aura farms every episode and beats the bad guy, yes A-1 and Sawano help take this series to new heights, but is it a crime to just enjoy shows for the spectacle? At the end of the day, anime is about entertainment and pushing the envelope of the animation medium, which solo leveling does. Not everything needs to reinvent the wheel, it’s sort of like expecting every meal you eat to be a Michelin star restaurant. It’s ok to enjoy\n                  ",

            "a fast food meal every now and again if you just view and accept it as such. That’s basically how I feel about Solo Leveling. It’s not the best anime ever, but it is very enjoyable and unlike many people, I actually enjoy the story, characters and premise. Season 2 was only an upgrade in every way for me and is a must watch for any action or sakuga fan.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nWhile I don’t think Solo Leveling’s story is the best, I have to say I’m in the minority of people who actually think it’s kind of good? Sure, it’s slow to play out, but there’s been a clear goal in this series from day 1, curing Jinwoo’s mother and not so subtle hints about the magic beast gates/raids being more than they seem. Season 2 builds on this by clearly setting up some greater power that’s pitting humanity against the magic beasts. For what reason? We don’t know, it’s a slow build up, but I completely disagree with the logic that “Solo leveling has no story” I really enjoy the mystery and speculating every week about what’s going on in the world. If you’re looking for something extremely complex then yea, Solo leveling isn’t going to knock your socks off, it’s unashamedly a power fantasy, but if you go in with an open mind and actually analyze it in good faith I think many people will agree that there’s a decent amount of intrigue here.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nMy one real complaint with Solo leveling is that Jinwoo feels so one dimensional. It’s like he actually regressed as a person, but improved as a hunter since he got his abilities. Sometimes it feels like watching a cardboard cutout rather than a person. That’s just me speaking as an anime only who’s only got these two seasons to go off of though. I assume he’s going to actually change as the story goes on and new threats emerge, but damn he just feels so edgy in this season. This isn’t entirely out of place given the stuff he’s been through in the past, his family situation, etc., but I would like to see a little more personality!",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nGoes without saying A-1 and Sawano delivered yet another masterclass this season. I think the OST is even better, the OP with my goat Felix from stray kidz and LiSA has been on repeat nonstop since it dropped. The fights in this season surpass the first and the art is very good as usual. The production quality is amazing, it’s one of the best looking anime out there and it just reaffirms my belief that A-1 pictures at their best are as good as anyone in this industry. SAO Alicization, 86 and now Solo Leveling have shown that they have arrived and are here to stay. So many times during this season I just found my jaw on the floor with how great the choreography and storyboarding looked. Bravo.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIf you step back and simply consider Solo Leveling as an easily digestible feast on the eyes with a simple, but interesting plot, you’ll enjoy this. If you come into it trying to be an anime critic and nitpick every aspect of the series, you’ll be miserable. There’s a reason why it’s one of the most popular manhwa ever. ",

To get money for his sister and find a way to save his mother. Why isn't there a time limit to this? His mother can just lay in bed for the next 10 years and his sister was doing fine even without the money. All they had to do was having his mother get so ill that she would die in two months or something and have it destroy her body. Same with the sister, just have her in heavy debt and maybe forced to work some side job that is dangerous and hinders her school life. Those are the smallest, easiest to implement changes and already you have some urgency, drama and tension which don't exist in this show as of now. Sung himself could have been also easily improved. Show hints at his moral fall but does nothing with it. Dude casually murders someone because in the state of panic a frightened npc attacks him. There are moments when he lacks empathy and comments on it, why isn't it expanded into something meaningful? Instead he is just cool, edgy and always wins. That is what I mean by the lack of ambition, the power fantasy aspect is just MC STRONG with no creativity or ability.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe fact that this show doesn't seem to realize how much it sucks is very frustrating. Anime genuinely tries to have me worried about the moron npcs like they are people or something. Oh no, will the sniffa lady designed to be in love with lil-bitch die on the first real mission I see her on? Oh no will those heroic fighters get wiped out (repeat 6 times)? Same with the mc. The funniest shit is how they try to build tension for every unlosable fight. I loved for example the epic music for the 1st episode fight between a summon and random bear, truly an epic face off. Even the premise of the show is abandoned. I know it is called Solo Leveling, but instead of just having grind from games they could have brough some fun gaming strategies. Never have I seen Sung go 'this fight looks tough let me buff myself, setup some traps and creativly use some skills/equipment' its always just SMASH or SLASH.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nEnough about obvious flaws, let's talk visuals.",
            "\r\nSolo Leveling is widely considered pretty which is true, it is also important to note that second season has a much better production quality than the first one. On the other hand one hears so much about said quality that you might expect something revolutionary like a consistent peak animation, I'm here to say that that is not the case. Before we focus on the fights it is important to acknowledge that we don't always have said fights and outside of them anime decreases in quality. Its not awful, it is just standard, sometimes lighting will be pretty cool tho. In the fights by far VFX are the best, some elemental spells look beautiful. Lightning, particles, etc. are cool and movement made slick. Fights have quite a few animation highlights to the point that sometimes we even get some decent choreography. It happens quite rarely (most prominent in the 6th episode). It is quite a high accomplishments for a slop anime, but it is important to remember than it has been done better before. Most disappointing were the backgrounds which at least sometimes existed in fights, but beside that weren't doing anything too impressive. You can see what I mean in the 12th episode. We change the fight to those controversial floating lines which always when executed correctly exists to highlight good background animation, but here said background is either non existent or gray and boring, with not much of anything going on.",
            "\r\nTalking about the climactic fight it was the biggest disappointment of Solo Leveling. 60% was just slapping each other, there was the aforementioned fumble with lines and the rest was also just vfx line attacks followed by damage, it looked cool, but was weaker than most of the other big fights of this series.",
            "\r\nWhole scale of the action sequences can't be handled by the anime. All the time we have big team fights and with so many individuals we often get to see a lot of poor cgi, which extends to cars as well.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nTo wrap it up, yes fights look good, but not good enough to carry this disaster on its own. That is why you can only enjoy this show if you can get entertainment from its super boring form of a classic power fantasy. You may say I'm nitpicking, but you have to realise that if all you have is animation than that is the level of scrutiny you are going to get. I genuinely believe that instead of watching this hit piece of shit you should invest 10 minutes of your life on research and you will easily find a truly good anime that has good animation and/or good power fantasy."

It’s not just a piece of fiction which has thrown quality season after season, it’s also one of the very few anime to have broken into the mainstream, so much so that people who do not watch anime at all have experienced and loved it. The emergence of the first season of Attack on Titan drove the series’ popularity to levels rarely seen before in the medium. The long wait before the release of season 2 was a major reason (along with certain pacing issues with the manga at the time) for the dying interest in the series\n                  ",

            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThen came Season 3, and the series was roaring back. The interest in the series had never been higher, and fans flocked back in droves to have their questions answered. Many began viewing the first two seasons in new light once the revelations showcased the intricate planning and immense foreshadowing that had gone under their noses when they’d watched it first. For me, Attack on Titan was always great. Never has an anime made me feel so hopeless if I viewed the world from the perspective of the characters. The absolute mystery surrounding the titans for most of the first season along with stunning animation for fights, memorable OST for almost any scene and emotional dialogue delivered by passionate voice actors made for an unforgettable experience. Season 2 and 3 bring in more revelations, slowly unfolding the mysteries of the world and the titans and shifting the themes of the series. Season 4 has another tonal shift - much greater than previous ones - and it handles it with aplomb.",

            "\r\nFortunately, MAPPA have handled the transition well. They haven’t been perfect (more on that later), but all in all, they’ve done a good job producing a new season of what is probably the most popular anime of the last decade.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe start of S4 might have left some people wondering where the original cast went. There’s not just a change of cast in the first few episodes, but also a switch in perspectives. We’re no longer seeing things from the side of Paradis and the Scouts. Instead, we now see it from the view of Marley’s warriors, who’re training to inherit the titans from their predecessors once their time runs out. Gabi and Falco want to inherit the armor but Reiner, i.e. the plot armored titan (Sorry, had to use this once I saw it on Reddit) can’t catch a break. Someone, grant him his wish to die.",

He wasn’t always a fan favorite because of his hotheaded nature, but as time went on, his perspective of the things around him changed, most noticeably multiple times throughout season 3. Come season 4, his character undergoes a paradigm shift; calm and sympathetic, yet ruthless. As his famous quote goes, “I won’t stop moving forward until all my enemies are destroyed.” He’s a lot more distant, not just to everyone else in the show but also to the viewers. Unlike previous seasons, his thoughts are a mystery and the season clearly displays the divide between him and the other old Scouts. ",

Yuki Kaji, the voice actor, supported this exponential growth by exceeding expectations on character delivery. I especially love how well he’s transitioned seamlessly along with Eren as a character and nailed almost every line. There’s hardly a line Eren has spoken in season 4 that isn’t extremely significant to the story.",

            "\r\nOh Gabi! Where do I even begin? She’s supposed to be the female parallel to pre timeskip Eren, but apart from some core traits like being stubborn, she isn’t really that similar to him. Gabi hates the Eldians from Paradis for no other reason other than that she thinks they’re devils and should suffer for the crimes of their ancestors. Eren was stubborn, headed into almost unwinnable battles without a second thought. However, his reasons to hate the titans were justified. His mother was eaten in front of him by a titan, his home destroyed and tens upon hundreds of his comrades butchered by titans in cold blood. He fought for his freedom, and humanity’s. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nGabi, on the other hand, hates Eldians without having seen any of them. She kills people for glory, just for some useless praise.

She’s neither a bad character nor a great one, but she serves her purpose.",

He’s her polar opposite, able to empathize with his enemies and an antithesis for every one of Gabi’s morals. He views things from a wider angle, often showing maturity way beyond his years. He might not be as naturally gifted as Gabi but he’s a whole lot more likeable. From posting letters for injured people to helping his enemies who shun him instead, this good boy has it all covered. He’s one of the beautiful things in this cruel world.",

He might’ve been a forgettable side character who didn’t even have a distinct design before S3 P2 (Isayama has himself admitted as much), but he’s one of the stars of season 4, running the show like the chad that he is. He’s an extremist and his actions are brutal; at times, it seems as if he’s doing it to sate his own ego and hate towards those who’ve imprisoned him and his race behind the walls. But despite all this, he’s one of the most entertaining characters post time skip. He’s unpredictable, spunky and has the audacity to pull off stunts that might’ve had your jaws slacking on the floor more times than one. And who can forget the “shh?” King Floch has unquestionably engraved his name as an Attack on Titan legend. ",

            "\r\nThe character designs in Season 4 see a distinct change, and that’s not all to do with the timeskip or the change in the studio. It’s a mixture of both. To anyone who’s read the earlier chapters of the Attack on Titan manga, it’s no secret that the art at the start was mediocre. Wit Studio did a great job of enhancing the character designs and the art in general, especially in S1.",

            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe animation of S4 has been the most talked about point, and for good reason. I’ll mince no words: some of the CGI was downright terrible. There was some genuinely impressive CGI like the Jaw titan, but some very important scenes involving the Attack Titan and Beast Titan were horrendous. It’s not the animators who’re to blame for this but the greed of the production committee and the manga publishers who wanted to have S4 airing before the end of the manga to boost sales.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nFor almost any other anime, I would’ve let even the terrible CGI scenes slide, but this is Attack on Titan, one of the most popular and highly acclaimed anime ever, and surely it deserved the best treatment possible. Unfortunately, it didn’t get that. Does it make the season bad? Of course not since the season covers one of the best arcs in the manga and the adaptation itself was faithful with top tier voice acting. Could better animation elevate S4 of Attack on Titan to higher levels? Greatly.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nMy biggest problem with the titan CGI was that it just broke immersion. One moment we had fluid 2D animation, the other we had some janky CGI lacking weight, which made me pause and check if I was still watching Attack on Titan. I’ve re-watched these scenes multiple times and every time, I came to the same conclusion: Attack on Titan deserves better. Remember the marvelous scenes with ODM gear we got in the first three seasons or the titan fights or Levi vs the Beast Titan? Unfortunately, we don’t get that level of animation in season 4, and while understandable given the time constraints, it’s disappointing nevertheless.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe CGI wasn’t always as bad, but had enough prevalence in the most important moments (Eg: Attack Titan vs Warhammer Titan) to be a stain on an otherwise stellar season.",
            "\r\n ",
            "\r\nWe have some new and honestly breathtaking tracks added to the already great OST from S1 - S3. One of the highlights in the sound composition this season is that there were different composers depending on whose perspective a scene is shown from. For Paradis, we have Hiroyuki Sawano back with all our favorites from previous seasons while Kohta Yamomoto handled the Marleyan side, giving us bangers including Ashes on the Fire. I missed the old OST in the first few episodes because I was worried they’d underuse S1-S3 OST, but they did not. It wasn’t used much because the initial episodes take place from the perspective of the Marleyans. Honestly, having different composers for either side of the conflict seems like a superb choice and helps immersion. ",

            "\r\nSimilar to the OST, it took a while for me to warm up to the OP, but looking back now, it’s great and suits the themes of S4. This was a common opinion amongst the community; the majority seemed to have disliked My War for the first couple episodes, then it just grew on people and now it sets the tone for the rest of the episode.",

            "\r\nNow that Attack on Titan’s final season (Part 1) has ended, it’ll be intriguing to see what route MAPPA takes for the rest of the adaptation. There’s anywhere between 13-16 episodes of content left to cover, depending on the pacing. Will the production committee see Attack on Titan as a chance to make hundreds of millions of dollars in a movie format or will we have Attack on Titan Final Season Part 2 (lol), only time will tell. I’m not against either, as long as they take enough time and pour passion into making it. I don’t mind waiting longer if it means getting the best production values. Hopefully, that’s the case."

Everything that came after s3p2 felt like it didn’t hit as hard as it, and wasn’t a proper successor.

Let me get one thing straight: you can say whatever you want about WIT Studio falling victim to Kodansha’s unfair and unreasonable production scheduling in the third season just like MAPPA is now, and how that lead to a double split-cour which ultimately wasn’t even enough to assure consistent quality throughout part two, but you must also admit pointing out these things is nothing more than a diversion from the far greater travesty of animation before you now. Attack on Titan: The Not-So-Final Season is a disgrace to the franchise which came before it on every visual level, and to say so is in no way to deride the overworked animation staff at MAPPA. Am I going to sit here and deny the existence of the throngs of rabid keyboard warriors on social media sending them death threats for producing such appalling CG and embarrassing 2D animation? No, but those people are foolish children with too much time on their hands, and by echoing their indisputably warranted criticisms, I and others like me are not justifying their acts of disrespect and harassment, so I urge you not to feel sorry for saying what you see clearly in front of you and criticizing it for what it is: an ugly, cheap anime.

Obviously, Araki’s heart-stopping visual direction and irreplaceable cinematic instinct made the anime adaptation what it ultimately was, but Hajime Isayama’s knack for framing an iconic single image when it mattered most still shouldn’t be overstated when the final season here has neither directorial flow nor memorable cinematics. The new character designs which pride themselves on their close resemblance to the original artwork found in the manga simply cannot use their adherence to the source material as a defense of their janky anatomy and inferiority to the beautiful artwork of Kyoji Asano, and the new music cannot use its passable composition as a defense of its utter incompatibility with Hiroyuki Sawano’s constantly recycled tracks. I understand this is a somewhat particular distinction to be made, but with the sheer amount of blatant animation shortcuts used throughout this season—not even counting the CG—season three part two looks like a studio trying their hardest while grappling with a ridiculous time table, whereas this looks like a studio using a ridiculous time table as an excuse to not try their hardest.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBut nevertheless, does the masterful writing save the day and make this thing worth watching? With how much is cut out, rearranged, and left unfinished, I would say no, but that doesn’t make it bad. If anything, the narrative has only gotten better and the themes have only gone deeper. With the basement and its contents finally revealed, the series had to occupy the world it so suddenly established and situate the story as we knew it within that world elegantly, and even with the content from the manga which got butchered in translation, it absolutely achieved this feat. As it demystifies Marleyan society and rationalizes the international bigotry towards the Eldian people, it builds the foundation for one of the most interesting and morally provocative conflicts I've yet to see portrayed in fiction, and it does so with complex characters who never fail to inspire emotion, or inspiration itself. While Attack on Titan: The Not-So-Final season is, indeed, not the final season, it’s still an adaptation of a manga, so it continues the story with more or less the same degree of excellence as the first three seasons did, and while it abruptly ends on a cliffhanger mid-arc, that’s more a testament to the fragile production than the source material, its quality of writing, or the acuteness with which said writing was brought to screen. One thing’s for sure, though, narratives as enthralling as this come once in a generation, and it’s a shame this one is receiving such paltry treatment.",

To cope with the extreme dejection I felt after watching such a dishonorable end to this once-great adaptation of an unequivocal masterpiece, I was going to try and write this review to examine the final season as a standalone work while simultaneously offering an all-encompassing retrospective on the modern classic that is Attack on Titan, but after WIT Studio dropped it and MAPPA shit it back out in such a visually repulsive and structurally incomplete fashion, I accepted the fact I couldn’t really do that anymore, and my enthusiasm burnt out along with the quality of the show itself. I’ve lost my motivation to even mind it anymore, and if the fact this season is among the highest rated anime on MAL didn’t make this obvious enough already, you all don’t seem to mind Attack on Titan anymore either. The reality that such a magnificently made work of art could receive such a stark downgrade yet still be well received by the exact same fanbase solely because they enjoy entertaining the mere idea of it is not only a sad reflection of the culture surrounding the work, but a cruel insult to the first three seasons which were only able to be the dazzling spectacles they were thanks to the back-breaking work ethic and tremendous talent of the original staff who so naively thought their admirable labor and impressive results weren’t lost on the audience, who’s appetite all can now clearly see as being apparently, totally mindless.",

      "Now in his second year of high school, Rei Kiriyama continues pushing through his struggles in the professional shogi world as well as his personal life. Surrounded by vibrant personalities at the shogi hall, the school club, and in the local community, his solitary shell slowly begins to crack. Among them are the three Kawamoto sisters—Akari, Hinata, and Momo—who forge an affectionate and familial bond with Rei. Through these ties, he realizes that everyone is burdened by their own emotional hardships and begins learning how to rely on others while supporting them in return. ",

Between tournaments, championships, and title matches, the pressure mounts as Rei advances through the ranks and encounters incredibly skilled opponents.

It’s even easier to empathise with Hina, due to her characteristics, with her helping Rei with his struggles and inspiring him to escape his depression.

His outlook and narration provide a strong connection from the viewer as he continues to improve his life which was once locked in place by his haunting past.

            "but with what it could have been. For a bit of context, I originally watched the first season as part of an anime club viewing (1 episode weekly) at my school. I remember never feeling that the show and I really properly got along. I was put off by the constant metaphors and imagery that seemed to be picked up in one episode and abandoned the next, the seeming lack of direction in the show’s pacing and plot, and the overall lack of true character development not only in the MC but also in those surrounding him. Some scenes, drawn and animated not beautifully but to a degree I could really appreciate, were strikingly offset by the garish “comedic” inserts that seemed to be inserted randomly and looked as if they were made right at the end of a weekly deadline. The music, while featuring some good tracks, was largely forgettable. It was one of the shows that I felt no connection toward and one that I rarely looked forward to seeing the next week. It existed, I watched it, and that was it.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBut after so many episodes, the first season finally ended and I was left with a choice – give it up or go on to the next season? My brother told me the second season was better, and it looked like MAL agreed. I decided it was best not to leave it undone and began the second season in the summer of this year. And now the real review begins.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nFirst, let’s talk about the animation. It’s good. I can’t fault Shaft for what they’ve done here. In particular, the openings tend to be very well drawn and make good use of color and lighting. But the second season still suffers from the bizarre comedic inserts that plagued my enjoyment of the first season. 3-gatsu is not designed as a comedic SoL, but for some reason the writers felt that their story would be better portrayed with numerous, brightly colored and loudly voiced insert scenes with 2-D caricatures of the main cast, often when expressing something intended to be funny or outrageous in nature. I found myself laughing at these scenes not because I found them truly funny (and I rarely did) but because they seemed so out of place in an anime that leaned so heavily on meaningful use of color, light, and sound to explain the story both within and outside of the cast’s heads. Furthermore, there was never a place during the anime where I paused and said to myself “what a beautiful scene,” something that I have found myself doing in the majority of shows I’ve scene (regardless of how well I like them). So in total, I found the animation and the art style good, but held back by some of the strange comedic inserts (though it is worth saying that there are less in the second season than the first).",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nLet’s move on to the music. The openings and closings, again, while being decent, are not memorable. I am a major believer in the idea that the opening of any anime play an absolutely critical role in setting the mood for the show, and those that do it well (looking at you, Spice and Wolf S1) are that much better for it. But very little about either of the openings (and closings too) use their positioning in the show to their advantage. I found myself skipping them more often than not. I only realized just how forgettable this show’s soundtrack really was until I realized that I could hum the next episode preview BGM more accurately than the actual opening – and that’s a bit of a shame.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nNow for the meat – the characters. I sincerely believe that Sangatsu no Lion suffers from the curse of Evangelion. While this is more prevalent in the first season, 3-gatsu is mainly premised on the MC, Rei, and the thoughts that rage within his head. But unlike Eva and some of its excellent protégé, this show does not use the “internal battle” motif effectively, and I believe it is mainly due to a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to tell a story. Like so many others, 3-gatsu is designed to evoke a sense of commonality in its viewers. You are supposed to resonate with Rei’s internal struggles and see yourself in them. And this idea, at first glance, is executed well. A boy, feeling outcast by his peers, picks up a hobby and meets other people to find new meaning in his life. It’s a realistic concept, while exceptionally overused, but it isn’t the problem. The issue comes with the context. Rei is a child prodigy, a middle school marvel who turns professional in his sport of the mind, Shogi. His family, having died in a car crash, leave him absolutely alone, adopted by a family who simultaneously reverences and disdains his skill. We pick up on Rei’s story as he moves out of his adoptive house to his own apartment, living entirely off his own income from professional shogi tournaments. The realism of Rei’s basic condition – outcast, depressed, alone – is tempered by the sheer unrealism of his situation and character – a genius whose entire family has passed unexpectedly, in the most stereotypical of anime tropes. This would be one thing if the show was written such that it was self aware of this uneasy juxtaposition between realistic and unbelievable, but it isn’t. At all points are the viewers stuck in the limbo between “yes, I identify with this” and “this simply isn’t me.” There’s a bit of Rei in most of 3-gatsu’s intended viewers, but there’s very little of the viewership in Rei, and the anime acts as if this glaring issue simply doesn’t exist. Shaft portrays the MC as a normal young man, without agreeing to the fact that he is anything but. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIn the interest of keeping this as spoiler-free as possible, I won’t dig too deep into Rei’s story, but very little of it helps the frustration I have with his characterization. As a slice of life, it follows his daily movements – to school, to Shogi Hall, to tournaments, and to the Kawamoto house. While the second season is notably better than the first in this regard, Shaft still suffers from the curse of pacing and focus. There are several sub-arcs in this season, lasting anywhere from one to several episodes long, but very few of them are properly followed-up on and brought to a satisfying conclusion. The writers introduce a character – normally one of Rei’s opponents but occasionally someone related to the rest of the cast – and draw out their character in great depth for a small while. You start to get excited: this is interesting. You become invested. But as soon as it starts, it’s over. The writers turn aside, never to bring the arc to its conclusion, and even some of the intimate insight we are given into the newly-developed character’s mind are cast to the wayside. Some of them reappear – too little and too late, unfortunately – later on in the series, but several are never heard from again. I suppose this may be Shaft’s way of pressing their overall thematic movement – that everyone is on the train of life together, and separating and joining is all part of the journey – but it’s overused and honestly frustrating by the time the season concludes. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBy far the best arc in the story deals with bullying experienced by Hinata Kawamoto, one of the three sisters whom Rei befriends in the first season. It’s realistic. It’s brutally honest in many ways. It resonates with so many of the show’s viewers. And unlike so many of the other disappointing sub-arcs, it is the only one that is actually brought from start to a satisfying (though still realistic) conclusion at the end of the season. But why? Why do you need a boy genius, an orphaned shogi sensation, and all the rest of the show’s unrealistic characterization to talk about such a mundane but meaningful topic? It almost supports the argument that 3-gatsu is better off without it. And it almost seems that the show directors become almost aware of this by the time the last season concludes. Rei takes his wins and losses less seriously. Shogi exists mainly as a continued tool but the show’s passion for it dies away. The boy genius becomes less and less notably for his acuity, but Shaft trudges on with the theme almost out of necessity. Why? 3-gatsu is one of the few shows where the unique premise (come on, how many anime are based around professional board game players?) drags it down rather than making it memorable. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nI have relatively little to say about the rest of the show’s cast and characterization, mainly because some of the most interesting characters have only a temporary turn in the spotlight just to be more or less used as distraction fodder for the remainder of the anime. Shimada and Nikaido – likely two most interesting and round (literally in the latter’s case) in the entire show, only appear as major story points in only a few episodes. While one could argue that Shaft is simply exercising reason with its balance of character development as to not overstep and overreach, these omissions are more frustrating than welcomed. You expect some deep development only to be played with a minor plot point or comedic insert. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nTo wrap up this review, let’s talk about what this anime could have been. The directing has a very solid grasp on conceit, and even does a decent job following through from arc-to-arc, season-to-season. The water analogy is used frequently and to good effect, not only for Rei but also for supporting cast members. The art, again, can be very appealing and used to good visual effect. Some of the characters – though perhaps not the main cast – are actually quite interesting and show some good, though limited development. But the off-putting insert comedy, the lack of ability to focus and finish on character development, and particularly the juxtaposition between a “realistic” and “unrealistic” MC ruined much of the show for me. 3-gatsu second season would almost have been more appealing for me had it focused on the life of a single, normal boy who experiences the realistic trials and struggles of himself and those whom he cares about without the shogi theme or the constant need to press the “prodigy” moniker.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\n3-gatsu is a superhero anime that masquerades as a realistic slice-of-life. As such, it fails at both without a shred of self-awareness of what it is trying to do. But I’m not mad I saw it – I think it really opened my eyes to what I appreciate in an anime, and made me respect just that much more how difficult adapting a source material into video can actually be. But perhaps unfortunately, finishing it has made me more excited than anything else to move on."

            "sort of obsolete to her father. Also it is implied that Kyouko sexually assaulted Rei when they were younger. Nothing is done with this in season 2. Akari at 19 years old had watched her mother die, her dad leave, and she was then responsible for raising her younger sisters. Nothing is done with this in season 2.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIt is incredibly frustrating to me how little development or new information there is in this season. I was really looking forward to seeing more of Rei and Kyouko's relationship, but it is as if she never even existed. If I was not supposed to care about her then why spend a few episodes in the first season making me care? I really do not understand this. I'm assuming this is addressed later in the manga, but Kyouko deserves more screen time. Ignoring her until she is maybe needed for some future episodes is not OK. Her story hasn't moved forward at all this season. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThen there is what the show did with Akari. Nothing. A 19 year old who is forced to raise 2 kids is not worth exploring apparently. A third season could explore her character more, but currently with 44 episodes out there just isn't enough to her character. She is a single parent who cares deeply about her family and is also working to support them financially. She never complains and is completely selfless. Her character is not believable. I need to know how she got to where she is, and what sacrifices she has made in her life, simply hinting towards it isn't enough for me. If she has accepted that she is a single parent and needs to dedicate a large part of her life to that, show her making that decision. She must have gone through a lot, and I want to see it. We know hardly anything about her. Also it is impossible for a single parent with a job to cook the meals Akari cooks and not be incredibly stressed and/or tired. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIf you were to add up all the scenes of characters cooking or eating with nothing important to the overall plot happening, it would probably be over an hour of footage. Most of what the sisters seem to do is cook and eat food. If you do not enjoy watching people eat food then this anime will be boring for a lot of its runtime. After really enjoying season 1 I was fast forwarding through some scenes in this, which made me feel sad. And does anyone really want to watch two old men argue about some shit that is unimportant to anything else happening in the series? Far too many scenes with old men being boring. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nRei seems happier in this season than the previous, but it doesn't feel logical. Previous plot points that would require Rei to change as a person to resolve are simply ignored so Rei can move forward. He mentions he doesn't have the confidence to phone his sister, and then it is never mentioned again. There is no substance to anything. His relationships with people need to be in a different place at the end of a season than to the start otherwise what was the point? The only character he connects with in any meaningful way is Hina. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe main plot of this season revolved around bullying. A serious topic and the anime does treat it as serious, showing how it affects children's lives. This is easily the strongest part of this season. Hina is bullied and it mirrors Rei's time in school when he was bullied and all alone. The difference this time though is that Hina is not alone, because she has Rei to help her. He wants to save her from what he had to go through. His motivation is clear and his actions (mostly) make sense. The resolution of the bullying would have happened if Rei was not even there and he himself knows this. However the support he offered to Hina helped her get through it and is reason for him to be proud. It was frustrating then when he felt like he did nothing; this could have been a turning point for Rei where he gains confidence and has reason to like himself more, but the anime hurries onto the next thing. On the topic of Rei and Hina, he is 18, and she is 13. Rei's teacher thinks he's in love with her and encourages him. He is 18. She is 13. Bad teacher! ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nTo conclude my thoughts on this season, I am quite upset to write that I disliked it. There were individual moments that were good, but the anime lacked focus. After the first season I was ready to recommend 3-gatsu to a friend, but now I am not going to (if a third season comes out and is as good as the first then this will change). I went through all the episodes in a short amount of time and honestly feel like it was a waste of time. It is possible that a third season could fix the problems I have with this show and focus more on interesting character development, and I really hope a third season does happen. A lot of people seem to love this series and me not enjoying it doesn't mean I want others to not enjoy it. I honestly tried to enjoy this, but I was left wanting a lot more.",

Bullying is a real world issue that effects millions of people around the world and contributes to suicide, depression, eating disorders, etc. Unfortunately, anime has a long and generally horrendous history in terms of tackling this topic. Bullies in anime tend to be like bullies in a Stephen King novel. They tend to be 1 dimensional bastards that exist solely to torment our heroes and eventually get their grisly comeuppance. When I heard about an anime that would finally give this topic the respect it deserved, I was thrilled! Finally an anime could help redeem over 40 years of the medium doing it wrong. Here are some reasons I feel this film fell short.",

Our MC Shouya repeatedly yanks out her hearing aids and destroys them in front of everyone. He does this EIGHT TIMES in 5 months and even makes her bleed out of her ears. The teacher just ignores this abuse until Shouko's mother complains. The teacher then singles out Shouya and only Shouya to be the fall guy. Does he get expelled? Suspended? Detention? Nope. His mother is told and she scolds him. Shouya doesn't take his loving mother's lesson to heart and physically assaults Shouko. The school STILL doesn't do anything against Shouya. Kid doesn't even get detention. I know Japan is a different culture than America, but WTF?! This all seems absurdly contrived.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\n Firstly, this would be far more believable if it was a Kindergarten class and not fucking 6th graders. Kindergarten kids have no established morals and really will bully kids in overt ways for being different. I still remember when a little Asian girl transferred into my all White kindergarten in Indiana. We all did \"Asian Eyes\". We all called her names. One kid started doing monkey chants, so we all started doing monkey chants. It was fucked up and I STILL feel bad about it now that I'm 30. By the the 6th grade, kids are FAR less likely to universally bully a kid for being a little different and the ways in which they bully are different. By the 6th grade, kids will bully by not talking to an unpopular kid, shunning them, and maybe attacking them on social media. A whole 6th grade class being supportive of physically beating up a little deaf girl and making her bleed from the ears is pretty damn unlikely to say the least.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSecondly, a character needs to do horrible things in order to set up a redemption tale. However, we are typically given a REASON why the character begins the story that way. This reason doesn't justify their actions, but it makes the audience understand the hero and what is going through their mind. Let's take a break from anime and look at another popular redemption movie, American History X. So why did Derek become a Neo-Nazi? He was raised by a father who was pretty racist and instilled a bit of that in him at a young age. Derek's father was murdered in a high crime Black neighborhood. Derek angrily blamed minorities for his father's murder and looked for groups to channel his anger. He ended up finding one of the many racist groups that exist in America both online and off, which reinforced his beliefs and helped mold him into the character we see at the beginning. Shouya on the other hand, is an absolute monster towards the handicapped for no reason. He comes from a loving, middle class family. He isn't a natural born sociopath. He isn't the least popular kid in school and desperate to make 1 person beneath him on the totem pole. He isn't being persuaded by some warped ideology that encourages bullying the handicapped in order to transcend traditional morality and prove himself an Ubermensch. He goes way farther than anyone else in his class and at no point are we EVER given a modicum of why or what he's thinking. Shouya begins the story a complete monster for no other reason than to set up a redemption tale. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nOk, so they fucked up a little. At least Silent Voice still tackles bullying WAY better than other anime...right? Honestly, no it doesn't. Let's set the bar really low and see how A Silent Voice compared to Elfen Lied, an anime that is widely agreed to have done a poor job tackling the issue. The main bully in Elfen Lied is a little brat named Tomoo. This kid is a 10 year old orphan being raised at a chronically underfunded and neglectful orphanage. Nobody is showing kindness to him, so he torments others in order raise himself up. At least we can understand Tomoo and his motivations, so point 1 goes to EL. Now let's look at their targets. Shouko is hard of hearing, but is otherwise an ordinary little girl. She is extremely cheerful and extroverted. No matter how much she is bullied, she forgives with saintlike compassion and tries to befriend Shouya, who just laughs at her and beats her up more. Lucy has red eyes and demonic horns. She objectively looks like a freak within her own anime. Prior to snapping, Lucy responds to bullying with the same cold, disdainful glare. Lucy doesn't try to befriend Tomoo. Her defiant attitude, difficulty showing emotions, and introverted personality all end up contributing to further bullying, which is accurate to real life. Point 2 goes to EL. Now lets look at how over the top the bullying was. The worst thing Tomoo did was beat Lucy's dog to death. Now in America, we value dogs at almost the level we value humans. Killing a dog is an unforgivable act of villainy. In most of the world, constantly ripping out the hearing aids of a little deaf girl, destroying them, and beating her up over a period of 5 months for no reason is far worse than killing 1 dog. Shouya's unbelievable, over the top cruelty exceeds any action taken by Tomoo. Point 3 goes to Elfen Lied. Congratulations Silent Voice! You just got owned by fucking Elfen Lied. You overrated piece of horse shit! ",

            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAfter 30 minutes of our MC being the biggest douche in anime that is NOT Dio Brando, we flash forward to high school. The entire class immediately switched from bullying Shouko to bullying Shouya. I guess they have exactly 1 target at a time. Now Shouya is a good guy and wants to make things up to Shouko. We of course already know Shouko is the most forgiving character that isn't supposed to be a Christ character or represent the very best of humanity, so our only real obstacle is another girl from their 6th grade class named Naoka. We see that Naoka still HATES Shouko and is an absurdly evil bitch because she blames Shouko for Shouya being bullied...even though she herself helped bully Shouya. In the manga, Naoka has her own redemption arc in parallel to Shouya's and ends up really developing as a character. In the movie, they had to cut that out and she's just an evil bitch that adds NOTHING to this story. She isn't even the antagonist of this tale. An antagonist actually ADDS something to the plot! I'm not going to spoil the whole ending, but I found its sentimentality to be utterly ineffectual. We also can't have an effective romance because that requires TWO likeable characters. The only character with any development and depth deeper than a rain puddle is Shouya. It's like the film writer honestly didn't give a shit about anyone else. ",

The romance is lackluster and I got very few genuine feels out of this one. The art and production values are spectacular. The premise on paper is great. Then it all seems to fall apart. Kind of like Joker Game in that regard, which I won't bother reviewing because I just basically did. I'm not going to warn people away and scream to \"Not buy the hype\".

It's inherently questionable to approach this topic from a romantic perspective because it's hard to sympathize with an object. And that is what Nishimiya is, an object. To be affected on, for us to pity, for us to see illness in a \"new light,\" to justify against bullying, to see the indomitable human spirit. A show like Monster works this concept excellently because it uses the object of interest (Johan) as more of a symbol.

            "\r\nIt is difficult to convey the emotions that went through my mind as I watched Clannad ~AS~. For those of you who watched the first season and dropped the show, I urge you to pick up ~AS~ and give it a chance. The first few episodes run almost identically to those of the first season, but the true After Story part branches off in a manner that is unique only to ~AS~. What Clannad ~AS~ gives the viewer is a story of life. A story of despair. A story of forgiveness. A story of hope. Through this story, Clannad ~AS~ can powerfully change the way you perceive the world around you. I am well aware that not everyone enjoys Clannad and ~AS~, especially since the magical light orbs are outlandish to some, but for me it was a bit of a godsend among anime.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe concept of Clannad ~AS~ is neither truly unique nor breathtakingly wonderful. What the viewer gets when watching it is the story of a man. Nothing less and nothing more. What Clannad ~AS~ really excels at, however, is the way it tells the story of that man. While it may be classified as a romance or even a harem anime by some (at least the first season could be), I really classify Clannad ~AS~ as a slice of life. A slice out of the life of a delinquent who can’t seem to do anything right and struggles to protect what really matters to him as the world comes crashing down.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nHowever, “slice of life” can be a deceptive term. As I watched Clannad ~AS~, it was not as much a slice out of Tomoya’s life but a slice out of mine. You see, what Kyoani succeeds in is hitting on the points that make life truly what it is. The continuation of time. The reality of truth. The genuine meaning of “life goes on.” Additionally, by extending over many years, the true significance of every event begins to emerge. Clannad ~AS~ takes the tale of the first season and shapes it around a single person. It is a respectable reflection of life and delves into what many shows do not, and cannot, represent: the story after the story. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nWhile many of the situations may be overblown and excessively dramatized (at least in the opinion of some people), it is ultimately true that every facet of Clannad ~AS~ gives the audience some insight into life. Does it matter that there are miracles and magic orbs of light flying around? For me, no. For others, this could be the case. That is to say, not all aspects of Clannad ~AS~ are perfect, but the impact was enough for me. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIf you are looking for a cheerful anime, turn away now. Kyoto Animation does many things with Clannad ~AS~ including some very effective humor in many places, but Clannad ~AS~ will make you cry and smile, often both in the same episode. I won’t lie, I cried at least 5 times throughout the season. Even when rewatching episodes, I cried again. Don’t get me wrong, Clannad ~AS~ really has some happy moments as well, but Kyoani tends to depress many, many times. Each sad moment is profound and beautiful, but nevertheless it is sad. The ending song, Torch, which is played in every episode, serves to alleviate this, for better or worse. Torch is very upbeat, but many people consider it unnecessary and I agree. Torch can be a real mood breaker at times.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe power that Clannad ~AS~ exerts comes from its characters. While the first season portrayed many main characters and their stories, ~AS~ focuses on the life of Tomoya and lightly on the lives of those who surround him. Tomoya is a failure in a cruel world. In a sense, he is a fatal hero. While he may not know it, he is destined to face pain and suffering through his life. There is a bit of controversy over the ending of ~AS~, but those who wish to have a “truer” ending can consider the second to last episode as such (don’t hate me for suggesting it). When seen in that light, Clannad ~AS~ effectively played out a story that neither catered to an audience nor skewed reality (except for the orbs of light, of course). What it presented was something that many people can relate to. The loss of a loved one. The pain of recovery. The neglect of a father. Rediscovering love and friendship. Coping with suffering. *SPOILER* The feeling of holding a daughter in your arms for the first time. The pains and joys of being a father. */SPOLER* What it ended with was a realistic ending and a message for the future. Additionally, if seen that way, the last episode can be portrayed as Kyoani staying true to the visual novel and respecting the source material.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\n*Unfortunately, more talk of the plot would undeniably lead to spoilers, which I am trying to keep free from this review, so please bear with me. Heck, if I’ve convinced you at this point, what are you waiting for? Go see for yourself what all the hype is about. Otherwise, read on!*",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nUltimately, Clannad ~AS~ molded characters that I thought I was familiar with into something close to human. Their stories produced emotion that made me reconsider the situations of the people that I see every day. Through social commentary and moral struggles, the viewer can genuinely begin to respect Tomoya. I know I wouldn’t be able to withstand half of what he did, but I truly began to respect the fact that he kept going, despite him being a fictional character. Through his struggles, I began to learn about myself. Through the struggles of those around him, I began to respect those whom I had once hated. This may seem extreme, and you may think that I am crazy, but what I write is nothing but the truth. Every episode gripped me, and many episodes evoked tearful reactions, which I am not very prone to. As I continued to watch, I could hardly bear waiting a week for each new episode to come out. At the same time, however, I knew that each episode held a bomb - a flood of emotions that could affect the rest of my day. Clannad ~AS~ went way beyond enjoyment – it went into the realm of what I could call an “epiphany.”",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nCan the story of one man influence the lives of others? Is it still possible if that man is a fictional character? For me, I did not think it was possible for anime to extend its influence at such a level. Clannad ~AS~ proved me wrong time and time again. Look past the first season and the first few episodes, and perhaps you can begin to understand what I mean. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nFor those interested or who can relate after watching the show, this is the ultimate and most powerful result of the show as it applies to me. The following is the reason why I can’t keep my mind off of Clannad ~AS~ and the reason why it will remain as my #1 favorite for what I know will be many, many seasons: *SPOILER* Through Clannad ~AS~, I have basically committed to wanting to have a baby. Ushio love. */SPOILER*",

            "\r\nClannad ~AS~ is unique in its storytelling, but the story itself is nothing special. The earlier episodes present almost unrelated stories just as the first season did, but Clannad ~AS~ takes a turn for the better with a focus on a single character and his ordeal. At this point, Clannad ~AS~ does nothing but follow the life of a young adult, Tomoya. Sure there is drama (oh, is there drama) and there is romance, in a sense, but in reality, there is no real plot to speak of. What there is, however, is the tale of a life experience that can change the way you live. A real deterrent might come from some of the magic that inexplicably finds its way into Clannad (both seasons), but that never really bothered me. The ending is also less-than-stellar and can be a bit confusing, but as stated before, there’s always the second to last episode to fall back on.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nArt/Animation:",
            "\r\nThere is nothing blatantly wrong with the animation quality. Kyoto Animation produced Clannad ~AS~, so fans will know that there is nothing to fear. The character design is the same as that of Clannad and other KEY adaptations. The KEY character design is quite distinguishable, with its giant eyes. Personally, I am a fan, but other viewers might dislike the artwork. Other than that, Kyoani did another solid job with the animation, and there are no jerky movements that detract from the gorgeous lessons that unfold.",

            "\r\nSound:",
            "\r\nKyoani had its ups and downs with the music for Clannad ~AS~. In many aspects, Clannad ~AS~ shoots beyond other KEY adaptations with its unique, unconventional plotline and incredibly well enacted scenes of what could very well be the life of an individual. In fact, many of the ordeals that Tomoya must face strike a particularly strong emotional chord among many people. Who knows, you might not be that certain type of person, but I definitely was. Anyways… back to the music. Clannad ~AS~’s opening sequence is a strong piano melody with deceptively deep lyrics. However, the ending sequence detracts from many of the spectacular moments, especially because Kyoani tends to end episodes on a sad note. As such, many would classify Torch (the ED) as an elaborate troll because it is too lively. Beyond the OP and ED, Clannad ~AS~ features tracks from the Visual Novel, which include very familiar tracks from the first season. Notable among these are the songs with lyrics, ie Ana. Certain parts of the OST mesh very well, and a powerful soundtrack can produce a powerful reaction. However, I don’t remember anything in particular clearly standing out to me, and as previously mentioned, Torch ruined quite a few strong moments.",

            "\r\nWhile most of the other aspects of Clannad ~AS~ are very similar to their counterparts in the first season, character development in ~AS~ take a turn for the better. Kyoani successfully made me hate characters that I loved and love characters that I hated. Through a roller coaster complete with dips and turns, Clannad ~AS~ changed the way I perceive all type of people. From Tomoya’s seemingly disinterested, alcoholic father to Nagisa, a character who I actually deemed annoying in the first season, I came to understand what truly makes up a person. Every character really has a story behind their dejected or cheerful façade. Despite the usual “Clannad magic,” every character also turned out to be associable, adding to the personal level of the show. Even the more comical, secondary characters had their share of emotional moments, giving them real depth and giving the viewer a relatively accurate understanding of human nature. About half-way through the show, there is a certain character that changes many, many things. I won’t spoil it now, but her unique appearance is what truly brought Clannad ~AS~ to unmatchable levels.",

Due to this, often times, those of us who claim ourselves to be critics of various mediums fall short of our own expectations. “Clannad After Story”, a series described as “life-changing” by many is the perfect suspect; a production that captured the hearts of the majority that viewed it while instantly becoming a classic within its genre. Littered with subpar designed moe characters, irrelevant arcs, contradictory elements, forced plot devices, and a plethora of other obvious issues,\n                  ",

            "\r\n--Story/Plot :5/10--",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\n“After Story” takes place right after the first season of Clannad and chronicles the lives of certain characters from the first season, primarily focusing on Tomoya, his relationship with Nagisa and more importantly, himself.  It attempts to bring a sense of realism to its viewer through the joys and hardships that Tomoya goes through and accomplishes that for a while. It also eliminates the harem aspect of season one and adopts a much more serious tone.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe series spans 24-episodes with the first 10-episodes composed of various arcs dealing with other characters and their corresponding dilemmas while the rest of the show focuses on the primary protagonists. This brings up the problem of structure and inconsistency. The initial problem with “After Story” is the characters that are focused on for the first 10 episodes. With the exception of the Misae arc as it LOOSELY connects to the magical component of the show, the other arcs have no direct relevance to the overarching story nor do they serve any function in moving the plot, but are just thrown in there, forcing unnecessary drama. This also causes a huge gap in consistency between the first part of the show and the rest, especially in regards to quality. However, the next few episodes are a pleasure to watch as they highlight Tomoya’s evolution as a character along with his relationship with Nagisa. Structurally, “After Story” fell short, consequently causing a gap in quality and consistency. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSubstantially, “After Story” has its share of delightful moments, but those are restricted to a very limited amount of episodes. The story is unoriginal, but imbues concepts and themes that are very real and relatable such as: imploring responsibility and growing up, the innateness of hardships, the importance of relationships, moving on, and many others that are close to home. Yet, “After Story” manages to ruin the very thing it tries to achieve. The show spends a great deal of time trying to evoke “realism” through manifesting the aforementioned themes, but subsequently destroys that with its detachment from reality and deus ex machina resolve. For example, one of the arcs in the earlier part of the series shows how two supposedly bitter and rival gangs end up being bros4lyfe via some [extraneous] female side-character. I may not have a proper grasp on gang psychology, but I’m fairly certain that the odds of something like a dudefest and “understanding” blossoming between two rival gangs are astronomical. This notion of “bonds of friendships overcoming everything” is extremely over exaggerated deeming many of the earlier arcs unrealistic,  effectively leaving me in a state of overwhelming ennui. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nFor a series that tries to emphasize real life, especially while trying to deal with issues such as loss, acceptance, etc., it negates all validity by embracing a faux idealism grounded in wish fulfillment. The realism juxtaposed with magical idealism/wish fulfillment really disintegrates the show by the end. However, that is probably one of the overarching reasons the show is as popular it is, because instead of staying true to its realistic core, it defaults into fantasy, idealism, and wish fulfillment. It’s successful but at the cost of complete contradiction therefore making After Story somewhat of a Pyrrhic victory. It should be noted that there is nothing wrong with having a plot based on supernatural/metaphysical notions, however, when the show is simultaneously trying to bring a strong sense of realism to the front, it becomes counter-productive and contradictory. I can’t even incorporate this under efficient “magical realism” because of how badly the two are handled when looked at as a pair. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nEssentially, where “After Story” excels at is deception. It does an excellent job serenading its viewer into a false lull making it seem exponentially better than it actually is by manipulating sympathetic themes and completely over exaggerating them, however, when dissected the story offers nothing unique, let alone life altering. It’s a good effort, but that’s all it is, an effort, that has its comely yet ephemeral moments. Conclusively, \"After Story\" ends up stumbling within its own narrative and resolution.",

            "\r\n “After Story” gets a ridiculous amount of praise for having “human-like” characters, however, the series lacks greatly in terms of balanced characterization. Tomoya is well developed and one can partly empathize with his struggles as he tries to shuffle through the various challenges he encounters. Tomoya’s progression is probably the most realistic part of the show and is fairly well-executed. While the show gives us a dynamic Tomoya, we are left face-palming in deep regret and resentment with the lack of attention given to Nagisa. There is nothing memorable about her; struck with some unknown illness, we often see her washing dishes for like three continuous episodes. I felt no sort of attachment, relation, or even empathy towards Nagisa, rather her lack of progression had the opposite effect. Her static, ingénue personality got unbearable. Oh and she can’t hold her liquor. That just heightened my insouciance even further. The futility of Nagisa truly is a burden on “After Story”. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe over-development of one protagonist and under-development of the other did not have a neutralizing effect, but a detrimental one. Their relationship is the foundation of “After Story” but it remains immature, mainly due to Nagisa’s incomplete characterization. Instead of spending the initial 10 episodes on completely useless characters, the series could have utilized the same time to construct Nagisa into a character with dimension, personality, and purpose. The show spent so much time trying to build this false delusion about how “friendship solves everything” that essential aspects got completely disregarded. Tomoya along with an unmentioned character carry the weight of “After Story”.  In hopes of keeping this review spoiler free, only the two main protagonists (Tomoya x Nagisa) are discussed.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThere are plenty of supporting/side characters in the show, some making cameos (from season one), others for reasons I have yet to understand. The only notable side characters are Nagisa’s parents who provide some comedic relief (which is the same recycled humor of the first season) but they still manage to maintain their likability. ",

            "\r\nDon’t hold your breath expecting anything aesthetically orgasmic. The girls are molded with “moe” in mind at all times: Unrealistic character designs for a “realistic” anime.  In terms of the actual art, “After Story” does a fairly good job. Bright colors are often used to accompany the magical atmosphere and vibrancy of life that the show is grounded upon. There are instances of visually striking scenes scattered here and there, especially with some of the natural backgrounds. There is always light illuminating from somewhere, even in the darker scenes. The one place where the animation did shine is while depicting the “illusionary” world. The background, colors, and overall depiction of that world is nicely done as it provides a very surreal atmosphere to the viewer. However, don’t expect gorgeous animation akin to something like “5 centimeter”. It’s nice, but nothing exceptional. ",

            "\r\n“After Story” has a viable soundtrack that fit its purposes. Composed of subtle, soft, and sometimes melancholic piano music, the OST is pleasant, but conventional. It wasn't something that compelled me to go download or re-listen to. The same applies to the OP/ED selections. They are very imminent and “of-the-moment” in the sense that they are enjoyable and appropriate at the time they played. However, I almost always forwarded the OP and rarely listened to ED. The voice actors are fitting in regards to their respective roles.",

            "\r\n--Overall/Enjoyment: 6/10--",
            "\r\n ",
            "\r\nUndoubtedly, “After Story” is at the forefront its genre because of its inherent ability to capitalize on emotions and “feels” to the point where many “manly” tears are shed and lives are changed. However, I could not relate; as the anime defied all levels of logic with convenient plot devices, contradicted its own pursuit of realism, over-dramatized situations, wasted 11 episodes of my time with frankly fatuous arcs, and underestimated the importance of complete characterization--emotions no longer mattered. After all, feels and impact are evanescent, quality is what remains. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\n\"After Story” therefore didn’t really leave a strong impact on me nor did I learn some particularly significant lesson about life nor did I put my feels on suicide watch. Nevertheless, the four or five episodes towards the middle/end are truly poignant and laudable—if  “After Story”  could have maintained that level of quality throughout and refrained from committing some of the aforementioned blunders, the series would have lived up to its hype. Alas, I cannot rate a 24-episode series any higher based on my enjoyment of five episodes. My “After Story” experience is a step away from the norm and that’s the reason I spewed all of this—to offer some solace to those who couldn’t cry those manly tears or indulge in wish fulfillment, while also providing another perspective to those who have yet to watch it that isn’t soaked in sheer “feels”."

            "\r\n",
            "\r\nUnlike \"Clannad\" though, \"Clannad: After Story\" is somewhat inconsistent. But I mean that as a back hand compliment, in that \"Clannad: After Story\" had the some good moments amongst the crap, while \"Clannad\" was just consistently crap.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe first part of \"Clannad: After Story\" is almost indistinguishable from \"Clannad\". It continues from where the original series left off, taking on a similar format comprising mini-arcs of various happenings around the school. Since Tomoya and Brown Haired Girl are already an item at the start of this series, there is no longer a harem aspect. You would think this would improve things, but in the case of this anime, all it meant was that it concentrated on mass producing contrived melodrama instead.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe first arc, starring Sunohara, was one of the worst offenders. It started off as a comedy, and although some parts were a bit tasteless, it was at least tolerable. Half way through though, it tried to turn into a serious drama, and it was all downhill from there on. The problem is that, as with most stories involving Sunohara, the comedy is quite ridiculous, involving an absurd set up that you simply can't take seriously, but the drama directly extends from that set up, and the anime seems to think it's fine to try and deliver emotional punches off this same platform that was used to deliver goofy punchlines shortly before. There are also glaring problems in the plot and inconsistencies in the portrayal of Sunohara's character, but the real crux is this: these problems are not oversights - these are the consequences of the show's willingness to sacrifice everything in order to crank up drama to 11. Not surprising then, that I found it so unconvincing.",

While I admit that the show does mature somewhat, its maturity is much like the way Brown Haired Girl matures during the show - she became more like a 15 year-old than a 10 year-old. An improvement it may be, but it's debatable whether this 50% increase in maturity is worthy of lavish praise when ",

            "\r\nBut allow me to pause in the middle of my acid spewing in order to acknowledge that there are definitely merits found in this part of the story, and that's enough to make it by far the best part of the whole franchise.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAs is always the case, these best parts centred around Tomoya himself and not some dipshit moe girl or some other retarded side character. One of the stories dealt with Tomoya trying to settle into a job and striving to overcome, amongst other difficulties, his physical handicap. This I liked, because above all, it was unembellished, believable drama - he actually had plausible real world problems to deal with, which isn't something to take for granted in the world of \"Clannad\", despite it often being labelled as a real life drama.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIt's fair to say that the franchise would be a lot worse without Tomoya; he was almost carrying the show single handedly. But there was one other, newly introduced in \"Clannad: After Story\", who shared his burden of being a rare good character stuck in the cesspit of shit ones. It's not too surprising then, that the stretch of episodes focusing almost solely on the two of them are the best ones that \"Clannad: After Story\" has to offer. Its emotional apex, a gorgeous scene set in a field of golden flowers tinted red in the setting sun, is hands down the most touching moment in the combined two seasons of the show. Emotional but not forcefully so, it captured the central theme of family with a poignancy and sincerity that's most unusual for the show.",

            "\r\nIn between the aforementioned high points, and even entwined with them, crappy arcs and sub-plots are found in abundance. Amongst them, there's the incident of an all important decision reached via baseball, and another one that dealt with matters between Tomoya and his dad. The former looks to be an instance of \"Clannad: After Story\" trying to be subtle by approaching the matter at hand in a round-a-bout manner, in the same way that an elephant might try to do ballet; the latter is another classic case of the show sacrificing its characters to the drama. Time and time again over the course of the two seasons I witnessed Human Plot Device, aka Tomoya's dad, demonstrate his immense capability by taking on whatever personality the plot required, and this unsurprisingly resulted in his character feeling like an unfathonable, contradicting mess.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nTo say the remaining episodes were unsatisfactory would be an understatement. To begin with there was the re-appearance of one of the most fucking annoying characters I've ever had misfortune of encountering, which invoked more sadness within me than all the sad stories in the whole series put together. And then there's the ending. I don't want to give spoilers, so I'll just say that not only was it confusing, but I would have felt cheated if I didn't have so little emotional investment in the show to be cheated out of.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThat aside, there's also some weird business going on with the ending to the main story not being the last episode of the series. There are two more episodes after the main ending: the first one is an alternative reality side story; the other one, the final episode, is just a recap. It's as if the show was going for the most anti-climatic end to a series ever. The purpose of throwing in that side story eludes me, but the re-cap's summarising did help to make the ending clearer. It doesn't clear up everything though, and there are major plot elements that remain baffling to the end. I did come across an informative time line that made references to the visual novel, and in all honesty, I was quite impressed with the grand scheme of what I saw. Unfortunately, various aspects of the plot failed to translate during the adaptation. Most notably, the visual novel mechanics they tried to port across caused plenty of confusion. The irony is that by trying to be more faithful to the source material, the anime actually ended up being worse off.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThat said, the ending is just a single nail in a rather large coffin; the show's problems run far deeper, right down to the conceptual level. Other than being filled with moe blobs that barely qualifies as characters, I get the impression that the franchise has been developed from a completely wrong approach. Instead of starting with some good ideas and letting them grow into good stories organically, it feels like the writers started with the intention of making the biggest fucking weepfest ever, then threw in whatever ludicrous ideas that came into their heads in order to achieve their goal. As a result, values like story and character integrity were continuously being compromised to make the show more tragic superficially. This might have been forgivable if it only happened on occasion, but when it's the bread and butter aspects of the story, the end product simply isn't a good drama.",

The anime brings the manga to life so well, with adaptations shattering all expectations. For example, that rap sequence in Episode 5 this season was one of the best single anime episodes I have ever witnessed, with references that made me shocked. Throughout the series, we’ve seen so many different references, such as the Monogatari series, Dragon Ball, and even Western culture references like A-Ha’s “Take On Me”, and Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody”. Once again, I cannot give enough credit to the staff for coming up with this type of modern masterpiece. What I find most impressive is director Shinichi Omata’s grasp of modern society. He has done his research on what kind of comedy works in this day and age, and it’s not always situational comedy, it’s comedy that harnesses works from other mediums other than anime, which is such a creative spin that borders on comedic genius. Comedy is subjective, and it’s possible that not everyone enjoys this comedy, but for me, it couldn’t have been much better and funnier.",

When we are in a good place in our lives, with little time constraint, it’s hard to leave the status quo. In fact, it’s scary leaving a comfortable place in our lives. For Kaguya and Miyuki, it would have been comfortable and fun to play their mind games forever, but each person has their own lives and ambitions, and when there is a time constraint, they had to act upon their feelings and get it all out there. It’s really a tale that depicts the different sides of every person, the playful side, the childish side, but also the mature side. It’s a pretty relatable story of one’s growth in high school.",

Ishigami has been one of my favourite characters since the first season, and he has a very intriguing personality, delivering cynical lines now for fantastic comedic relief. Tsubame is the leader of the Cheer club and the organizer for the cultural festival, so naturally, she was pretty popular amongst the students. Ishigami doesn’t come off as a very confident person, so a relationship with him and Tsubame didn’t seem very possible at first, but Ishigami, with some help from Kaguya, was able to take action in search of a date with her. The funny thing about all this, is that this is hypocrisy to the highest degree, in that she’s telling Ishigami to go forward with his ambitions, but she doesn’t want to confess to Miyuki herself. It was honestly very entertaining to watch the twists and turns of this relationship play out.",

I found that when there was a great episode, I always smiled throughout the end credits, and honestly, this show made my day sometimes. It’s one of the most fun I’ve had with an anime ever, and if anyone ever wants a funny romcom to watch, or even if they’ve never watched anime, this would be near the top of the list for me to recommend.

It goes like this; introduction of the characters, most of the number episodes are full of slapstick comedy fillers that are not irrelevant to the plot, and some sudden serious moments in the last few episodes. I thought this season will be different but it followed the same formula that I mentioned earlier. To be frank, this season is boring, compared to the other seasons. I know it’s mainly a troll comedy but it’s a romance too. I was annoyed with this kind of formula because I don’t know when this show is going to be serious at some point. I don’t know why the author started to pulled those side characters, as they are irrelevant to the main plot. I think he wanted to splitting his attention onto numerous side characters giving us several different generic romances at the same time. Mostly the developments will happen in the last few episodes and it’s lacking, as I expected this season would become grand since manga readers overhyped this. Come on, it’s the third season already. It suffocated me for some reason and the flow of the story is the same all over and over again. I wonder why the chapters from the manga are extremely long because the story has fillers and is mostly stretched out.",

            "\r\nGoing to the “filler episodes” that I mentioned before, it’s… average. Not unlike the previous seasons, that full of surprises. The quality of the comedy was degraded, since the dialogues are the same as in the previous seasons, and the jokes were overused and felt forced. It’s like they were trying hard to be funny like before but not anymore. The expressions, the punchlines, the vibe, and many more are like from the previous seasons. The segments are still the same but from different situations. The aftermath punchlines from the games were quite more predictable than I expected. In short, the comedy in this show is repetitive as fuck. I think only 100% die-hard fans of this show and new to comedy can laugh to these. The only thing that surprised me was the rap segment. I mean it’s from the same segment when Mama Chika teaches her son, Shirogane to improve his talents and skills. But, the unexpected actual rap battle between the characters was surprising.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAs for the “serious romance” that was lacking, due to the lack of episodes for the serious moments, the festival arc was very generic and annoying. It’s like a minimalized version of Rent-A-Girlfriend that Kaguya couldn’t confess to Shirogane, even him, each other due to unexpected reasons. Remember when Shirogane invited Kaguya to enjoy the festival? She thought that if the students see them together, there will be rumors that they are dating. It’s just one of those Kaguya’s habits from the previous seasons, just to intimidate Shirogane. But, so it’s not a right, and is it bad for Shirogane to enjoy the festival too? One of the reasons why I don’t get Kaguya’s motives at all. If I may remember, those two or three episodes of the festival arc, led to a cheesy and predictable “serious moment”, where Shirogane will leave the school to study abroad, that lasted just 1 or 2 episodes. Again, this is the third time that they used the same formula from the previous seasons. That last episode lasted an hour and it was pretty rushed than the manga. The pacing was fast, I think and they condensed those 10-15 chapters, I think into an hour, heck it’s 45 mins if you exclude the commercials. At the part where this mysterious thief showed up, I predicted that was one of Shirogane's schemes. Well, the legend of giving hearts was the catalyst for Shirogane to come up with a plan to confess to Kaguya. I don’t know if is it just me because I watched too many romance shows and films, and this kind of scheme was pretty obvious. The dialogues were half-baked and didn’t reach the point of the “serious” moment. It’s pretty cringe to be exact. I really hate the forced drama in this show. Of all the seasons I've watched, the drama in this season was all over the place. It shouldn't be here in the first place because there's no room in this show for a drama. It didn't made fucking sense at all. The strengths of this show were in its hilarious and unique premise, but it excelled as a comedy that satirized romance tropes, not as an actual romance. From being a unique school comedy to an unfocused mess of a generic school romance anime. And heck, this is one of those failed attempts of romance. The part when Shirogane invited Kaguya to join him at Standford was pretty obvious. I mean they are both geniuses for fuck sake so there’s no way that it’ll not happen. They didn’t confess to each other at the end, and the whole thing ended with a ridonkeylous kiss. And the bad thing was, they censored it for no fucking reason. Remember, a kiss has different meanings. Overall, all the “serious” stuff, in the end, was cliched, forced, half-baked, and predictable. It was a beautiful moment, but still a generic melodramatic romance. If you want a truly romcom anime that ended with a romantic kiss, go and watch Maid-sama. It's more of a romcom than this.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe characters are still the same. For this season, they developed due to their inspiration for their crushes. The main characters, Shirogane and Kaguya, were pretty developed. They set aside their pride to conceal their feelings and fought with each other if who’s the one would confess first. As for the other characters, they are still funny, likable, and absurd as ever, and that’s it. They are still the same as the previous seasons.",

Although I had problems with the OP. The OP from this season was pretty weak and I like from the previous seasons better. The ED was okay, nothing to be surprised about. The music was still forgettable in the end.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nOverall, this season was pretty weak than the previous. Honestly, I enjoyed a few of the segments, but the rest were pretty the same. I had a few laughs from some parts of many segments from this season, but I expected something greater quality of the jokes than the previous. The previous seasons are still superior compared to this season. I set my expectations high that this will be different, but in the end, hope seemed to be lost. The serious development was good but honestly, the whole thing could be better. Even if the jokes from this show are new and executed well, it’s still a hit-or-missed comedy in the end.",

Now season 1 and 2 were both perfect examples on how to balance your characters, the main characters (Shinomiya and Shirogane) are both entertaining and get a lot of screentime in the first 2 seasons, but this is also in season 3, the thing is with the main characters is that the side characters also matter a lot.

What about Ishigami though? He got attention, right? Well, yes but in my opinion, not really in the right way. Shinomiya and Shirogane are the main couple in this series but Ishigami now has a crush i guess... There's nothing wrong with having 2 couples in the same series but i don't like how they just randomly switched perspectives and called them 'parts'. Like bro, i just wanna get to the business already. Now onto enjoyment, probably the most important factor into rating an anime, i already mentioned this but the main characters should be supported by the side characters to actually be an entertaining character, if they aren't, 90% of the time the series feels empty and boring since the main characters are most of the show. And that 10% which is actually entertaining is usually very short, liw is also very repetitive, this issue also occurs in the first 2 seasons but i feel like its more prevalent here because the times where it is repetitive is with the 2 main characters. Now to the ending, the ending that made liw gain .20 points and make it tied with fmab, i'm not gonna spoil anything but all i would like to say is that it's a cringefest with very specific things that happens which ruins Kaguya's very specific plan. Personally, i don't like this season but entertainment and comedy is subjective (even though i feel like there was a lot less comedy and a lot more romance in this season). I can see why someone would like this show if they just loved romance but i don't really dig this style right now with Kaguya Sama, yes i do like my romance then and there but i think i would rather watch Squid Girl then oh wow i like this person now lets come up with this extremely specific way to confess to them which gets ruined by a extremely specific way."

The Kiheitai present Gintoki with a job: find Takasugi, who has been missing since his ship was ambushed in a Harusame raid.

This season focused on that very aspect.

Scratch enough. It felt like they had the bare minimum amount of capital required to produce 10 episodes which they stretched into 12. The fight scenes seemed surgically pruned in length. While I'm no supporter of 50-episode battles...previous seasons man, previous seasons.

            "\r\nBack in winter 2016, Gintama° was pulling out the two greatest arcs of the series. And, one of the best action-drama sequences ever seen in the shounen genre. The amateur studio BN Pictures was in a pinch with the production. Yet Sorachi's writing was shining at its brightest, pushing the series to a whole new level. After the end of the Farewell Shinsengumi arc, Sorachi had two options. He could keep pushing higher, to scale up the series' finale with the power of the previous arcs. Or he could go through the lazy writing route. Sad\n                  ",

The basic plotline of the \"story arcs\" still the same. Lack of comedy might turn off some fans, but it's not a problem at all. What was not done right then? Why one of my favorite titles felt so mediocre in this particular season?",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nEmotional stakes. Not the lack of them, but the distance of them from the plot stakes. Picture this: A beloved one of yours turns into a evil monster. He wants to end his own misery but he can't do it himself. Then he realises the only way he could do this is to destroy planet earth. And the way he finds to achieve his goal is to provoke a universal-scale war. Now you see yourself going to a foreign planet far from home to... Do you see the problem here? We are going too many places and too far away only to get to a single point: The clash between Gintoki and Utsuro. All these light-years made plot and emotional stakes too apart from each other. Now the story is involving a lot of people, parties, places and actions. And all these have little to nothing to do with the emotional conflict. Tying emotional and plot stakes together is no easy task. Creating big ass events to see the action roll and nothing else sounds far easier, right?",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBesides, the visuals looks the same from the last cour of Gintama°. Nothing impressive, as expected from a low-budget production. One of the most disappointing aspects though, is the lack of new OSTs. Sure, they added some new sound, but they for the most reused tracks from previous seasons. Almost every major arc from the 2015 season had their own OSTs, so what happened?",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nMost fans of the series will still love to their hearts this season. Shounen genre addicts can still find a good deal of enjoyment here. But, if you are one of the few people that loved Gintama for the writing gems it pulled out (aside the comedy), for poetic arcs like Mitsuba or Red Spider, for heartbreaking drama from Shogun Assassination and Farewell Shinsengumi arcs... Better stop. The next arc, Silver Soul, is by far only a bigger fest of the same meals compared to Rakuyo arc. Stop here, and save yourself from watching the fall of Gintama."

            "\n        In 2012, Bleach ended its long anime-run without adapting the final arc from the manga. Dubbed as part of the 'Big 3', it almost felt like an end of an era. Some fans were left confused that the anime omitted its final arc although it's understandable that the manga was still ongoing at the time. Almost 8 years later, Bleach's massive 20th Anniversary Event breathed new life into the franchise as we got the final arc anime announcement: Bleach Thousand-Year Blood War. Mind you, this isn't just an announcement for what fans wanted after all these years. It's a celebration for the entire Bleach fandom.",

Initially, he didn't expect Bleach to bloosom into the franchise as we know today but mangaka Akira Toriyama provided the encouragement for him to succeed. Tite Kubo's creative vision to make characters dressed up in kimono and supernatural monsters associated with spiritual themes is what made this franchise so special. Of course, he was influenced by other works but Bleach still stands out as a very special show on its own.

They make an immediately impact by disposing a lieutenant and challenges against the very best of Soul Society. Led by the Quincy King Yhwach, their true agenda remains a mystery but it's clear that they are a prominent threat against all of Soul Society and the human world. Even the world of  Hueco Mundo isn't safe from their wrath as Ichigo and his allies decides to take a stand against this new threat. Watching the Thousand-Year Blood War Arc immediately shows just how dangerous and capable the Wandenreich is with their special abilities, equipment, and ruthless ambitions. While not much is known about their, some of their members display a malevolent aura that borderlines on a God-like complex. If there's anything Bleach has taught me about its antagonists, it's that they often come across as charismatic characters such as Sosuke Aizen and the Espadas.

The oddball of this show is Uryu Ishida, because of his status as a Quincy, and this is a source that gets complex this season. Unfortunately, this season doesn't truly dive into Uryu's motivations or what his true purpose is yet. Most interestingly however, we come to know a deeper background story of a few Soul Reaper captains including Genryuusai Shigekuni Yamamoto, Kenpachi Zaraki, and Retsu Unohana. Even Ichigo's parents gets a spotlight this season as we come to know how Isshin and Masaki met in their past. It's important because Bleach has a large cast of characters and we can easily get lost. This season took its time to give these characters more meaning with their stories. But fear not, other favorite characters in the franchise also makes a return including Toshiro and Byakuya. They've received storytelling about their backgrounds in the past before so this season mainly reminds us how strong they've become.",

Battles scenes have been enhanced to bring the fights alive from the manga. Most importantly are the way this season adapted its character emotions. There are several episodes where we see how characters are pushed to their limits when emotions take over. This season captures the essence of those emotions at their fullest.

            "\r\nWhich is a shame, as it's only after about 20 episodes that this series progresses from something that is slow, somewhat overly bombastic, and hinting at more to come to show itself to be one of the most intelligent pieces of anime that's been made to date.",

What it has, though, is a sense of scale that's unsurpassed in any anime - or, for that matter, any television show - I've seen.",
            "\r\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes centers around - you guessed it - a bunch of people who, according to populace at large that inhabits the fictional future this series plays in, are of heroic proportions. That is to say, heroic in a very classical sense, being possibly a negative thing as well as a positive. ",
            "\r\nThe series is set in a future wherein the universe known to man is divided into two camps, the aristocratic and absolutist Galactic Empire, and the democratic Free Planets' Alliance, who have been embroiled in a war for some time, seemingly",
            "\r\nbeing evenly matched. This balance is shattered when a military genius with a far-reaching ambition rises on the Imperial side, prompting the Alliance to, somewhat grudgingly, give ever greater backing to the most capable officer on their own side. Both men surround themselves with able staff, who become legends in their own right.",
            "\r\nIt sounds like your average hero of freedom-versus-tyrant story, but it turns out to be anything but. First of all, the heroes do have a sense of their own importance, but also the sense to question whether they are all that special, or whether the circumstances of their times have just brought them to a spotlight which people equal to them could never have aimed at. More importantly, the main question on which the whole series hinges remains an open one. This question is the age-old one of which is better, autocracy or democracy, the problem being that a good autocracy is usually better than a good democracy, but a bad autocracy being worse than a bad democracy. Within the happenings of the show, it becomes apparent that, militarily speaking, at least, a good autocracy has an edge over democracy in terms of speed and decisiveness, and this shows in how the series progresses. ",
            "\r\nA large part of the series is devoted to showing the war and its subsequent smaller-scale rumblings. The war is fully shown from the side of the commanding officers - one of only a very few shows to do so - and does show an appropriate sense of scale. With battles involving thousands of battleships and millions of men, simple depictions of large-scale tactics take the place of views of the battlefield itself, and a considerable part of the show is, laudable, devoted to discussions on logistics and military intelligence. ",
            "\r\nA larger part still, though, is devoted to discussions on politics, all within the greater autocracy versus democracy question. Again, these thoughts never go very deep, but what strikes one is that so very many possible variables are brought up. Almost any motive of rulers or the general populace that might affect a political decision is included at some point in the show, making me at least think to myself: 'They even thought of th&aacute;t one.' The show does tend, here and there, to lean toward the old 'good soldier, bad politician' clich&eacute;, but, overall, it really lacks a clear villain, instead showing each possible side (apart, perhaps, from religious fanatics) from every possible angle. Moreover, all this is shown within a future universe that is highly consistent over the full 110 episodes, even if differences between the warring sides tend to be somewhat exaggerated: in many cases whole societies seem to act a bit too much according to a somewhat radical ideology, only to make their following actions be true to form.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThis being true to form applies also to most of the actions that, at first glance, seem to be overly dramatical, in the first place many of the actions of the dozen or so main protagonists. However, when thinking about the how and why of their actions, it usually becomes clear that they cannot have but acted as they did, according to cultural mores and individual character. A case in point would be the reliance of many Imperial officers on the character of some military commander to predict his battlefield tactics. This would seem lunacy, until it is remembered that the Imperial commanders are a tight-knit group, mostly of noble birth, and known to each other: each commander would know the peculiarities of all others, which become all the more predictable as the importance of gaining personal glory and honour in battle are taken into the equation. ",
            "\r\nThis reliance on known characteristics of all personalities is also possible because the characters don't evolve all that much. Now, I've never understood why 'character progression' in general seems to mean having characters make a full volte-face, and I am, in fact, happy with a series that shows all characters as being fully grown, and fixed in their ways. Each has a specific role to play, and a mind-set that might be predictable, but is, again, true to form. This doesn't make the character shallow. Far from it: their characteristics mean that each takes a single position to a fitting extreme, making for interesting differences between the characters, and accompanying differences in outlook. ",
            "\r\nThat said, it is indeed true that the characters may be somewhat flat, and quite a few seem to be included only to show a different point of view toward a specific situation or theory, but it is exactly this relative flatness that makes it possible for them to discuss so many situations.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAs for the art, it is old and outdated, but that can't be held against the show. It is a shame that, mainly in the first season, the series is at times simply bad: persons walk in an awkward way, scenes are recycled, and even relative positions of facial structures change from frame to frame. There's no excuse for that. Technically, though, the art definitely gets better during the course of the show.",
            "\r\nIn fact, the show being old might be a boon. The creators have opted to make the drawing style relatively realistic, which fits the series splendidly. One has only to look at the manga to see how different it could have been: the style of the manga doesn't fit the show at all. ",
            "\r\nReal points have to go to the design. Again, nothing is really innovative, from the spaceships to the almost 19th century looking setting to the uniforms of the soldiers. It is, however, solid, and consistent, and really brings the world to life. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe music is outstanding. It mainly consists of generally well-known classical compositions, which, granted, have been often used before, but never have they been used to such splendid effect: especially the use of pieces during battle sequences, fitting the individual scenes to the music, is a joy to watch.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAs a whole, Legend of the Galactic Heroes never tries to be overly deep, and, though it tends to be somewhat bombastic, never loses itself to any glorification. It is slow and quite meticulous, focusing on a lot of details, and consists for the largest part of dialogue, not action. The story progresses slowly, and only after about a season's worth of episodes the real story starts to evolve. ",
            "\r\nAnd this show never, ever tries to evoke an emotional response. The whole series is based on having the viewer have an intellectual understanding of what happens, not an emotional one. There are, thus, no cheap tricks to elicit emotional response, nothing overly dramatic (barring a few strokes of bombast), and no characteristics that make a main protagonist or villain.",
            "\r\nI can only applaud this, considering it a feat to produce such a good series without relying on drama. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is, in this sense, the absolute antithesis of my other personal favourite, Le Portrait de Petit Cossette, appealing to the rational side of the viewer, even when the protagonists act with all their vaunted 'foppery and whim'."

            "\n        Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu is a somewhat odd series, in anime terms. It began as a series of novels in the 80s, got adapted into a manga and, over the course of the late 80s to late 90s, it was turned into a 110 episode OVA. The odd part being that it was released as an OVA. For those of you who don't know, an OVA is a direct to video/ DVD release rather than one that runs on a televised network. Usually OVAs are pretty short, running somewhere from an episode to maybe a dozen. A hundred and ten episodes is virtually unheard of from\n                  ",

            "an OVA. Why was it an OVA? I have no idea. It's possible that its content was deemed unbroadcastable at the time but I really don't know. Let's take a look at this insanely long OVA. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe basic story is that two forces, the Imperial Empire and the Free Planets Alliance, have been at war for centuries and the plot follows their conflict and struggles with a focus on the politics and stratagems. So, how competent is the execution? The short answer is it's not but allow me to extrapolate. The first issue is that the strategies used in this shouldn't work. They're really basic and rely on the other side being incompetent. The first strategy you see is “get all our ships together and hope that their fleets are far enough apart that we can take each one out individually before they can meet up.” It only works because the enemy is stupid enough to disperse their units far enough that it can work. There's another strategy that basically comes down to putting on enemy uniforms and using one of their ships. So, these guys have been at war for centuries and no one has ever tried disguising themselves before? For that matter, they don't keep track of their lost ships or have any kind of code words to identify their own soldiers? The future is dumb. That leads to another issue, since the strategies are pretty much all ones that shouldn't work you can usually tell which ones will or won't based entirely on whether it was one of the main characters who came up with it rather than based on any merit in the strategy itself. If either side had a single person who had read and understood Sun Tzu's Art of War this would be over in five episodes. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe political “intrigue” also falls pretty flat. Its big downfall is the narrator. Yes, this series has a narrator. The narrator likes to tell you what the impact of any political discussion is going to be and even spoils death scenes. Just to make sure they leave as little impact as possible. Even putting the narrator aside, a lot of the political points they make are either stupid or get contradicted by the series. To give an example of the first, they have a criticism of the Alliance's leaders that “they aren't going out and fighting” and the series acts like it's a brilliant and poignant point, but it's not. Any war effort needs people to take care of getting resources, oversee distribution and hundreds of other administrative details that you couldn't do while also fighting. Furthermore, you don't want your leaders going into the fray because of the potential for social disarray if a bunch of those leaders were to just get killed all at once. Do they really think that social chaos would be good for the war effort? The future is dumb. This series also advocates the idea that war leads to societal advancement and society stagnates under peace. That's another particularly stupid one. Society doesn't stagnate in times of peace. It advances technologically and socially. Quality of life goes up and social problems are gradually taken care of. Frankly, the societies presented in this series could use some social justice advancements given that their gender roles have regressed back to roughly the 1950s. The future is stupid. Moving onto a contradiction, towards the end when it looks like peace is coming one of the characters discusses how “if only they'd been able to just talk so many lives could have been spared” which is fair enough but not even five minutes later he says that he's going to return to being a soldier and fighting. Yes, if only your sides could just talk, you know, rather than planning for the conflict to resume. Why is the future so stupid? Even putting the major issues with the politics aside, it's just dull. The scenes drag on far longer than they need to, especially since the narrator has already told you how it's going to turn out in most cases. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe characters in this are pretty flat. Most of them are defined by a couple basic traits or an archetype. Like the guy who doesn't talk or the aggressive guy. Even with over a hundred episodes to work with, none of them ever get around to becoming fleshed out or developed in any substantial way. The female characters have it even worse since they get to be defined by their relationships to the men around them, usually their love interests. If the characters were compelling the series could have at least had some emotional investment but they aren't. They're boring.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe art in this is really badly done. The characters tend to have these flat, emotionless expressions or look dully surprised. I remember one death scene in particular where one of the characters was looking at a dying loved one and their facial expression was what you'd expect from someone who had been staring at a computer screen too long and was tired, not the expression of someone losing a loved one. The action scenes are really bad too. The space combat scenes can be summed up as “phallic ships fire at each other. Some get destroyed. Cut to one of the major characters standing in their bridge and either giving orders or reacting while looking strangely emotionless.” After a while they all start to look the same and kind of blend together. The land-based battles are even worse, somehow. You get a lot of scenes where soldiers are firing shots at people who are charging with melee weapons and somehow miss every single shot. Cobra soldiers are better marksmen than these clowns. Making one side incompetent because you want the soldiers on the other to survive doesn't make the surviving squad look bad-ass. It just makes the action sequence look lazy. Characters will also go cross-eyed for no reason and a lot of the movements just end up looking stilted and unnatural. The art is also a problem when it comes to death scenes. There are quite a few that are supposed to be dramatic but end up being done in such an over the top way that they end up being humorous instead. Like Toga Guy's. (That isn't a spoiler. He dies very shortly after showing up and it's obvious from the moment he appears that he won't survive.) ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe voice acting is the best part of the series. It's not the best, but the actors do a good job of emoting and delivering their lines. If the art actually gave the characters expressions that matched the dialogue it would be far more effective, but at least the actors were putting an effort into it, even if they were the only ones involved in the OVA who were. The music is pretty mediocre. It's not bad, but it's not good either. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe ho-yay factor is a 2/10. There are some scenes where Kircheis and Reinhard look like they're more than friends. There's also a scene about the Empire's history that involves a gay Kaiser, but that's the extent of the homo-eroticism. There really isn't much. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThat's Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu. It's actually pretty painful. Sure, you get the occasional scene that's over the top in a funny way, but most of the time it's just slow and boring. Any potential for dramatic tension is lost thanks to the narrator, the strategies are idiotic. The politics are asinine. The characters are flat and the art is really bad. My final rating for this is a 2/10. I would not recommend slogging through this one. Well, that's the last review of March. The request queue going into April is: Shinsekai Yori, One Outs, Doki Doki Precure, Sword Art Online and Shingeki No Kyojin. Next week I'll look at none of the above and check out Muteki Kanban Musume instead because I really need a laugh. I'll get back to the queue after that."

I had to force myself through sixty hellish episodes for the first serious arc to show up. I've said it many times and I'll say it again, if a show takes 60 episodes to start getting interesting, then it is a failure of a show. The story during the first season was generic at best, it had these boring episodes that were 20 minutes long, but felt like a movie or a lecture, and had uninteresting side characters who magically showed up to ask our hero Gintoki for help. It also became a bit interesting and emotional at other times, with good written characters who had unique qualities about them and gained some form of character development (mostly the main villains and the Shinsengumi). The narrative was all over the place, Gintama had a serious arc that made you cry at first, but the next episode was all about poop jokes and toilet paper. I'll give the show credit for having interesting arcs, even though it had no continuity and was random. Those interesting arcs that made me cry in Gintama's first season were not present here, the funny episodes were not present here, the boring and stupid episodes were though. ",

            "\r\nInstead of having one good episode at the very least, this season insults your intelligence by presenting you with characters who come out of nowhere and are still unfunny (insert the same lame joke used by Sarutobi about her love for Gintoki, or Zur- I mean Katsura saying \"Zura ja nai, Katsura da\" for the millionth time), gags that did not make me laugh one bit (Oh no, another lame DBZ parody) and villains that were laughable at best (Insert loser ninjas who wanted to kill Sarutobi and lame empress who wanted to take over Gintoki's town). With the first season, the parodies were actually funny at times, since they were actually well made and had a good premise and buildup to begin with. An example of this would be Gintama episode 119, which was one of the funniest episodes in the series, and it managed to do a DBZ parody the right way. This season also had no good serious arcs, villains just show up and then are magically beaten by our annoying mary sue MC and his very annoying sidekick (you know which sidekick I am talking about). Characters are shown to die, but are healthy and alive, standing atop of buildings the next day! Wow! Gintama might as well insert the Dragon Balls into the show as an explanation for this amazing plot armor, that would actually make sense and would be funny. The story is just uninteresting, cheesy and another generic shonen at this point, the only difference is that filler is said to be canon here. Nobody dies, heroes win in the end and the plot moves at a very slow pace. ",

Shinpachi's sister, Shimura Tae, is a carbon copy of Shinpachi but with no glasses and with taller hair (Gintama even makes a joke about this, most characters are based off of Shinpachi's bland design).

The good ones I already mentioned countless times above in this review, the Shinsengumi. The Shinsengumi are the ones who made me endure more than 200 episodes of this show. Hijikata was funny in every gag he was in (2 of my favorite episodes involved the guy), his backstory and his development were brilliant, and his shining moments were fun to watch. Sugo was amazing as well, his character was by far the most developed in the whole show, his backstory was emotional and made me cry, and he had his bad-ass moments too. These characters did not only feel real, three dimensional and brilliant, but they also had an interesting chemistry between them, seeing them interact with each other was the best part of this show. Kondo was also a good and interesting character, though he did become annoying at times. Ito and Housen were one dimensional villains at first, but slowly became more developed as their arcs went on, and their goals and ideals started to make more sense by the time their arcs concluded. Kagura by far has the best backstory of the bunch, and episodes involving her were so sweet to watch, her relationship with others, and the contrast she has with her brother made me want to see them meet and interact (Unfortunately, I dropped the show, sorry Kagura). Gintoki is a good character, having him be a grown up loser was interesting to see when all you find in shonen are these optimistic happy go lucky young protagonists, though the fact that he can beat any character through plot armor annoys me.

Shinpachi, this guy is so bad to the point where even some fans don't like him, he has to be the most annoying character I have ever seen in all of Anime. If he is not screaming in your ears every 5 seconds, or explaining the joke to you and ruining it in the process, be certain that he is doing another equally annoying thing to piss you off. Shinpachi is a creepy character and a big hypocrite, he has this fan club where him and his Otaku followers obsess over a pop singer called Otsu, he tells his followers that they should not love any other girl, instead their love should be devoted to this pop singer, who will not even look them in the eyes. Shinpachi is not only satisfied with being a creepy weirdo as we can see, he also goes next level and becomes infuriating when he beats up his Otaku followers for having normal relationships with other females. He's also a hypocrite because he does the same shit, yet nobody beats him up. ",

His entire character is not developed in the first 201 episodes of the show, so I just gave up on him becoming an actual developed character. Instead, he became predictable. Whenever Katsura shows up, all he does is say his iconic phrase, call Kagura boss, do something stupid and place bombs on the Shinsengumi. This is what his entire character boils down to. I want to like Katsura as I have found moments where he's shown actual development, and episodes where he's made me die laughing, but until now he's not a good character. I dropped this second season at around episode 21, and Katsura still had not developed by then.",

Tsukuyo is introduced for fanservice and for the shippers to ship her with Gintoki, I find her to be more annoying that Otae, that's an accomplishment in itself. Otae is a bully, though her relationship with Kyubei was certainly executed well, and she had a bit of depth and some funny moments. ",

Whenever Gintama surprised me with three or five good episodes, and I finally was beginning to think that the show was starting to become consistently good, it came back to punch me with three or five terrible episodes. Whenever it surprised me with a well made, exciting and tear jerking arc, it came back to disappoint me with a boring arc I had no interest in.

For an anime that seems to do everything right, it isn't talked about a lot at a popular level. Neither has it been successful in garnering a fan base similar to that of SNK or SAO. I decided to write this review to do the show justice.

After learning that his father left him at a young age to become a Hunter, Gon decides to follow in his footsteps not only to find him, but also to see what was so special about the profession that made his father choose it over him. Although a story of finding one's father is simple, it is the path that is taken towards this end that makes the series truly special. HxH is made up of several arcs that are all extremely well-written, which brings me to the best part of the series, the writing. Hunter x Hunter (2011) boasts one of the finest writing in the world of shonen; the depth and flow of the story, enthralling characterizations, strong dialogue and impressive world-building are all crafted into a fascinating tale that can absorb viewers into lengthy marathons. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe amount of variety that is packed into HxH's story is also very impressive. HxH successfully dabbles in several genres in six story arcs tackling survival, fighting tournaments, crime thriller, virtual realities, war and politics. Not only that, the series is also able to undergo significant tonal shifts with ease (light to dark and vice versa). Sometimes, these shifts in tone occur after an arc ends though other times, it even occurs mid-arc. Another thing about HxH is that its arcs are connected with one another, with each arc naturally following the one before it. This creates a natural transition that highlights what the series really is, a journey. As for pacing and development, they are excellent. For the most part, HxH is very well paced. The series does a fantastic job at keeping its viewers engaged, time will fly by as you watch most episodes and you'll find yourself breezing through the show. Excluding two recap episodes, HxH has no filler episodes. Due to this, story progression is solid with the plot moving forward with each episode.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAlthough HxH initially gives off a light hearted impression, it gives off a good one. Not the kind of “light heartedness” that makes you say “this is childish and below me” but the kind that appeals to everyone. HxH gives off that classic and charming shonen vibe that has been lost in recent years, and it does so with its head held up high. Eventually though, the series takes a dark turn. Although most HxH story arcs are light hearted, both Yorknew and the Chimera Ant arc are two of the best and darkest arcs shonen has to offer. Yorknew can be described as a dark thriller in a big city. The central theme of the arc is revenge and it is similar to Death Note in terms of thrill and atmosphere. On the other hand, the Chimera Ants arc can be described as an attempt by the Hunters Association to control an outbreak of a dangerous man-eating species. It is the darkest and most thematically powerful arc in the series tackling themes such as identity, human nature and survival of the fittest. The arc has drawn comparisons to Yu Yu Hakusho’s Chapter Black for its seinen-like nature and is similar to Shingeki no Kyojin, where the protagonists experience a strong sense of despair in the face of a vastly superior, hostile species. The series undergoes major tonal shifts in both arcs with the color palette, music, atmosphere and amount of violence changing significantly. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nHowever, what sets the series apart from other battle anime is its unorthodoxy and unpredictability. Shonen tropes and storytelling methods are undermined throughout the series. The main character for example, Gon, fails more than he succeeds. Power-ups based on emotion or willpower are non-existent and fighting in the series is radically different from other battle anime. The main protagonist is not the main focus of every arc either. At certain points in the series, you could even say that Gon has taken a supporting role, especially during the later portions of the CA arc where he isn't given as much focus due to the grand scope of the story. The standard battle anime formula of “lose-train-win” is also undermined. Although there is training, it does not always translate to a victory, nor does it propel the protagonists over or to the same level as their main adversaries in terms of strength. For the most part, the protagonists assume the underdog role. Although they have incredible potential, they are still kids who have a lot to learn. In terms of storytelling, unpredictable developments are commonplace. One thing that continues to amaze me with this show is how it leads viewers into thinking that the story will progress in this direction, only to change course and arrive at a completely different outcome. A good example of this would be the series' arcs which often end in an anti-climatic manner. Basically, there are a lot of scenes and story developments that you won’t see coming because they defy conventional shonen storytelling or are unpredictable in their own right.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nThe series' unorthodoxy can also be seen in its fights which are primarily cerebral. In addition to being well-executed, HxH fights are smart and involve a lot of strategy. Raw power is a factor but it is not the factor that decides battle outcomes, actual power (nen abilities), experience and strategy are all taken into account. If a main character is outclassed by an opponent in all or most categories, he is likely to lose. Moreover, main characters are not given any special treatment in combat. This smart approach to fighting is further enhanced by nen, a unique and complex power system held by defined rules. The concept of nen, its principles, aura types and many applications on the battlefield reveal the huge amount of thought that was put into it. I still remember having to pause episodes, even research a bit during its introduction, just to digest it in its entirety. ",

As new viewers delve deeper into HxH, they realize that there is much more to the show than its cover art and synopsis suggest. Expectations of the series being immature, simple or generic are progressively overturned as the show reveals its surprising underbelly.",

With the exception of a few minor characters, the voice acting in this series is excellent. As a person who has never seen the old series it’s hard to believe that these aren't the original voices because they fit extremely well, especially those of Gon, Killua and Hisoka whose voice actors do a perfect job of capturing their characters.

The series does a great job of capturing facial expressions and everything from the lighting, shading and colors adjust perfectly depending on the mood of the scene or the tone of the arc. As one reviewer (nagaiyume) said, the bright colors of the show might need some getting used to, though it is usually fans of the old series who have this problem. Personally, I think it fits the show perfectly. It adds to the charm of the series by complementing its sense of adventure, uplifting atmosphere and unique appeal as a shonen that looks simple but is actually remarkably deep. ",

Although some may initially come across as “generic”, these assumptions are gradually undermined as the series progresses. ",

            "\r\nIf there's one thing I want to emphasize in the character department it would be the series main villains. When it comes to characters, this is where the show shines the brightest. HxH villains are extremely well-written (with the exception of the Bomber who won't apply to most of what I'll say below). Not only are their characterizations independently impressive, they are also distinct from one another; no two villains are the same. This distinctness does not only apply within the series but outside of it. You won't find another Hisoka, Chrollo or Ant King in any other anime. This is what makes HxH villains so compelling, in addition to having really impressive characterizations, they are also original. Although I excluded one out of the four main villains from most of what I wrote above, all HxH villains do have one thing in common. Each villain strikes fear into audience, the series does a good job of establishing the level of danger these characters bring to the story and our protagonists. ",

            "\r\nHowever, while HxH is a great series it isn't perfect. The series doesn't have a strong start, it takes three episodes for show to get going. I've seen a lot of people drop HxH early and it sucks because the first two episodes don't capture the series at all. Things start to get mildly interesting in the third episode, after that, the series just gets better and better. HxH also suffers from occasional BGM misuse. There are odd sound choices for some scenes. Sometimes they don’t really fit, other times they don’t fit it all. Lastly, the Chimera Ant arc also has minor issues with both Togashi and Madhouse to blame. Togashi’s fault lies in his writing during the middle of the CA arc which I think, pales in comparison to the rest of the series. HxH has made a name for itself for holding a consistent high level throughout its run; it’s a series that’s just so engaging and easy to marathon. However, I believe this consistency took a hit mid-CA arc (due to handling of the story and pacing) specifically, episodes 89-98. Don’t get me wrong though, I think there are a fair number of good episodes within that 9-episode stretch but unfortunately, they are surrounded by mediocre episodes that break the consistency of an otherwise exceptional arc. Madhouse’s fault lies in its adaption of the manga chapters comprising episodes 113 and 115, which were dragged out in order to have episode 116 handled by their best animation team. Episode 113 was actually well paced except for one atrocious sequence while episode 115 as a whole was generally poorly paced.",

            "\r\nIf you’ve been reading up about HxH, you’ve probably seen some people complain about the “poor pacing” during the “narration heavy episodes” of the CA arc. Well if you’re wondering how much truth is there to this statement and were going to ask me about it, my answer would be it depends.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAt episode 111, the palace invasion (climax of the CA arc) begins and narration begins to play a huge role in episodes in order to (1) pack a whole level of depth into the story and (2) increase dramatic tension. Rather than a high octane \"action fest\" people would expect from a shonen arc climax, the palace invasion takes a psychological heavy route wherein a character’s thoughts and mental state are given more focus than the actual action. This psychological focus together with the narration slows down the pace considerably in the sense that episodes begin to cover a lot less in narrative time. However, despite this “slowed down pace”, the pacing of these episodes remain solid with good amount of manga chapters being covered during each of these episodes and the duration of scenes being on point (except for episodes 113 and 115 which I mentioned earlier in this review).",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIn the end, it depends if the narration works on you or not. If you like the psychological approach and experience an increase in suspense then you’ll have no problems with the pacing and are in for one helluvah of a ride. However, if you don’t like the psychological approach and feel that the narrator’s heavy presence breaks your immersion then you’re in for a grueling experience. Of course, there are other combinations such as liking the psychological route but not feeling the immersion or maybe the narration just didn't work on you completely. Well, if this happens to be the case then you’ll end up with mixed feelings. On the bright side, most people who end up watching the invasion end up enjoying the narration. However, if you happen to be one of the good number of people who end up not liking the narration don’t worry, only episodes 111-118 of the palace invasion have heavy narration. After episode 118, the narration begins to decrease and episodes eventually reach a point where they are “back to normal”.",

            "\r\nAlthough I love the fighting aspect of the series and consider it to be a strong plus, I’ll leave this out there for the sake of subjectivity. HxH does not cater to everyone. Although fights in the series are well-executed, they are also short (1-10 minutes) and happen less in comparison to other battle anime. Moreover, the focus on strategy in battles might be off putting to people who prefer fights with more brawn and less brain. If you're expecting an action heavy series like Yu Yu Hakusho then you will be disappointed. This is because HxH is a series that relies on its story to reel in viewers. Personally, I think this is how fighting in shonen should be done. Fighting should be able to entertain and also make you think. It shouldn't drag on for too long at the expense of the story without leaving you underwhelmed. ",

            "background. You’d be thinking after reading this that I’m no fan of Hunter x Hunter, but that isn’t the case. (I would definitely not be writing this lengthy review of a TV series if it didn’t mean much to me). Back in 2016, after reading somewhere else how this series was “so much better than Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood”, a series I had recently finished and liked, I felt naturally interested to know what the craze about this show about a boy with spiky hair, a green outfit and a fishing rod was about. I knew it had two versions, one from 1999 and one from 2011, but as a lover of the 90s cel-animation aesthetics (and because it had a dub in my own language), I felt inclined to start it with the older one. And it was love at first sight. It’s quite hard to describe with words, but never before I had felt with such intensity a true sense of immersion from the very start. Hunter x Hunter made me understand the true meaning of the word “hook”; I was to my surprise immediately and joyfully dragged into its world thanks to its enormously captivating, mysterious yet realistic nature and atmosphere and its irresistible somber feel, that made me want to genuinely follow this orphan kid in his quest venturing into the unknown, uncovering mysteries, facing all sort of obstacles and meeting friends and foes in his way. And by the time I finished the mind tests in Trick Tower, the feeling of amazement had become so intense that I knew this series had already become an instant all-time favorite. The original version of Hunter x Hunter gave me a watching experience of those you don’t find very often.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nI didn’t honestly feel much of all this when starting later the 2011 remake version by Madhouse. I don’t want to sound like an annoying broken record here, but I really have to say that when it comes to the execution of the first four arcs, Nippon Animation’s 1999 adaptation is so immensely superior that it’s hard to understand how can anyone who has seen both of them believe otherwise. This is not just because of the grittier, bleaker art style and the more natural, earthier color palette and shading/lighting -both in characters and backgrounds- that mix together to create a delightfully sinister, realistic atmosphere that makes you feel you are not only a mere external TV watcher, but instead another character inside this wondrous yet wicked world joining the adventures of our cast, a feeling present since minute 1 that expresses at its fullest during the York City arc, where the city is not shown just as a mere setting, but instead as another omnipotent character lurking from the shadows enveloping the whole cast and narrative. It’s neither just because of the much more realistic characters' designs, nor the more mood-setting, emotion-stimulating music, that here is crafted with way more personality and is more than just BGM; it actually plays a key role in establishing the atmospheres, creating the moments and sucking the audience into the world. No, it is also -and mainly- because of the overall direction and this very meticulous, careful attention to small details which are the true responsible of fully submerging the viewer, capturing way better its desired sense of adventure and mystery, cleverly composing and joining together each scene, setting way better the desired moods for the right moments, keeping the viewer at the edge of his seat always wanting to know how the story would unfold, and ultimately bringing a vastly more exciting, warmer and memorable experience.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\n2011, on the other hand, is just not the same. There’s nothing technically wrong with its execution, but here I didn’t feel the same level of mind, heart and passion poured into its production that I did feel with 1999. For a lack of a better term, the best way I can describe it is that it just feels “okay-ish”. It lacks touch. It feels somewhat insipid. It just does what it has to do, with minimal effort required. Let’s do what we have to do quick so then we can go to party. The art doesn’t feel anything special, and the colors and lighting decisions don’t suit the overall dark, gloomy and realistic nature of the show (the colors are just excessively bright and the edges too clean to be able to create a more human, natural, relatable environment and the rough, outdoor sense of the show; instead, they make it feel more artificial, plastic-looking and videogame-ish. Nothing inherently wrong with this, but it’s just way less charming, haunting and inspiring!). Some of the characters' designs look too goofy for their own sake, especially Illumi, who in 2011 looks more like a ridiculous clown, whereas in 1999 looks actually like the menacing, merciless creepy murderer he is. Music is nowhere as full of personality, mood-stimulating as the one of the older version is and the tracks are barely memorable, some of them painfully generic (especially the boring drums and guitar riffs one, that doesn’t suit well with the tone of the series), though I have to admit that it improves a lot later during the 6th arc. (Although, when “Legend of the Martial Artist” is played like 2 times per episode, it eventually becomes tiring). But much more important than art and music, is the way the story is told, and especially during the Hunter Exam arc, where the differences are more noticeable. I can’t blame those who say that this arc was “nothing special” or “generic, boring shounen introduction”, because it’s precisely this okay-ish execution that makes it feel like that, as opposed to 1999 where it was a complete different story! The older version put much more attention into the introduction and build-up of both the world, the characters and their backstories, there you can see them interact more with each other and you can see how their relationships grow more smoothly, it does a much better job when it comes to establish a genuine sense of mystery and intrigue about what would happen later on and there are many scenes with nice attention to characters’ facial expressions, showing what are they feeling in regards to everything they are living, an approach that here adds a great sense of naturalism. The 2011 version just paled in comparison regarding this, which decided to speed things up by cutting many relevant moments in order to get to the unadapted content as soon as possible.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nI initially wanted and I’d love to delve more into this matter by providing and describing concrete scene-by-scene examples, but considering that would have made this review insanely long, I had to dismiss the idea. Nevertheless, I think my point is clear, and these comparisons can be found with great detail in many other places for anyone interested. All I’m going to add here is that it saddens me the little love and attention Nippon Animation’s adaptation gets in comparison to Madhouse’s one, when it isn’t in any case inferior to it despite the latter going further in the story, much less for shallow reasons such as “because old animation”, “because newer version with higher resolution”, or because “it has fillers” (seriously, this idea that 1999 is “dragged by fillers” I don’t know where does it come from, when the filler count is a mere FIVE episodes and guess what: they are GREAT! Since not only they are actually well-integrated into the story, but also they enhance it: in particular, the additional bonus stage in the exam where the examinees have to cooperate together in order to make an abandoned battleship work to save themselves is very good since not only is highly enjoyable and one of the highlights of the arc, but also because it sets a nice contrast with the following test where they would have to hunt each other). Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to say here that 2011’s version of the earlier parts isn’t worth the watch, it’s just that the 1999 one is in a whole superior level, it’s something else, is way more enjoyable, is the one that understands that there’s a viewer outside the screen eager to live something memorable and the one I would recommend, even if unfinished.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBut of course, putting stylistic and directing differences aside, substantially speaking on paper it’s 90% the same thing. Regarding the first four arcs (Hunter Exam – York City), it’s a competent show featuring a well-constructed, well-thought intriguing storyline that flows well from arc to arc, blending well the dark and lighthearted moments, and there’s hardly anything wrong to say about them apart from a somewhat anti-climactic ending for the York City arc that didn’t live up to its full potential, by leaving some things not concluded and postponed for later on. It also features a likeable and relatable, yet complex set of characters each with their own motivations, backstories and well-defined personalities that feel real and contrast nice with each other, with Killua being the most interesting of the bunch as he’s the most mysterious and layered one and rightfully so the one that “steals the show”. (There’s also this debate on whether Gon qualifies as a “typical shounen protagonist” or not, which I will not address here since, typical or not, he is a good character anyway). With the exception of ¼ of the main cast (Leorio), all of its members receive a fair share of attention and/or development at some point. The set of antagonists is also good with the Genei Ryodan/Phantom Troupe members being the highlight, who are more than just bad guys who want to do bad things because villains and feel real with good motivations, distinctive personalities and backstories as well. Finally, it features a complex power system (nen) that allows creative fighting (though there’s nothing inherently wrong with just power levels and brute strength, by the way). I don’t want to delve further here since all these elements have already been described better in other reviews.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nHowever, by the time the 5th arc of the show -Greed Island- starts, where Gon and Killua would participate in a game Ging had created and would train their nen abilities, the first real problems arise when part of the “magic” is gone; the series starts to feel quite different by the introduction of a straight fantasy and scifi-ish vibe with the whole getting inside a video game phenomenon (even if later it’s explained that it wasn’t really that) which felt out-of-place when remembering the fairly realistic, natural setting and what I like to call a warm “wood and stone” vibe that had characterized the show so far and which caused the audience to feel a little uneasy. The fantasy elements of the show, which so far had been limited to just some special, quirky abilities of the nen users and some weird creatures in the beginning, are taken to an extreme here when nen starts becoming the excuse for all kinds of unimaginable situations to happen, like building up not only an entire island out of nowhere, but also its inhabitants (!), materializing from nowhere any type of object just by spelling its name, getting teleported and summoning an angel that would out of nowhere regenerate a body part. It was in this arc where it became evident that Hunter x Hunter didn’t have the intentions to keep its original concept the viewer had stuck its mind to and had invested its expectations. Nonetheless, these feelings of strangeness still lay within tolerable boundaries and were nowhere as strong as the ones the next arc in the series would give, an arc which in my opinion, consists in Hunter x Hunter’s fatal error, the lethal wound from which it would never recover and the main reason explaining its non-functioning condition.

Regarded by many as the so-called “best arc in shounen anime”, the 6th and longest arc in the series is without a question the fan-favorite one, the one that explains most of its praise, and the reason why it places so high in anime online rankings. However, to my eyes (and fully aware I’m in the minority here) the story is quite the opposite: it’s actually the main reason why I think Hunter x Hunter (2011) is NOT really a series that works well, why it frustratingly disappoints and why I had to sadly withdraw from this Hunting party after seeing the direction it had taken. And this is not because “it drags on too long” or because of the “heavy, annoying use of narration”, which are the two most common criticisms people make towards it (and that to my eyes, are not problems at all), but rather because this arc…has absolutely nothing to do with anything that had been shown before. It’s a total momentum breaker, a complete deviation from the premise that had been developing so far, that established an annoying sense of discontinuity thanks to a sudden, unannounced change in focus, making the audience ask itself: “what is this? This is not what I was watching!”. This can be better seen and understood by making a recap of all the previous arcs.

            "\r\nHuh? This “6th chapter” I’ve just described, as it can clearly be noticed, has little to just no relation with the five previous ones, and constitutes a drastic rupture in the flow of the story. In one minute, it is about a boy who was in his quest to find his father and in the next one, about the same boy and his best friend fighting and stopping from dominating the world powerful beasts that -narratively speaking- come out of nowhere. There is no natural continuity here; the arc is entirely a forced detour from the street in which the plot had been driving so far which hadn’t even been previously signaled at all (foreshadowing), inevitably catching the audience off-guard since there was just no way it could see it coming and getting prepared for it. In other words: the Chimera Ants arc simply pops-up in the middle of an unconcluded story, interrupting the natural flow of the show’s overall narrative, changing both its focus and vibe overnight and forcing the audience to now pay attention to something else completely unrelated to what it had invested both its interest and time in. It almost feels like the magical card Gon uses at the end of Greed Island arc teleports us to an entire different show! No offense to anyone here, but it really makes me wonder if all those who didn’t have any problem with this were actually caring about the story they were watching or not.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIt doesn’t help the fact that the transition to its development is not even credible (in which case its inclusion would have been at least more acceptable). Gon and Killua, since the ants issue clearly wasn’t something related to their dad-finding quest and wasn’t any type of “next stage” he had prepared for him like the Greed Island game was, never had any believable reasons to join Kite’s biological investigation and to get involved in it from the beginning, even more when considering that it’s not as if anyone had asked or obliged them to do so or they never really had an option. After spending 75 episodes worth of sacrifice, pain and struggle, facing and overcoming all sort of complicated obstacles to find his dad… why would exactly Gon after all this, have any real intentions to embark himself into another different mission that just never had anything to do with him (and dragging Killua in the process, since he just follows him anywhere he goes) and was not going to help him to fulfill his initial real objective? His attitude made no sense, and his curious voluntary decision to join Kite’s team was nothing but an artifice on the part of the author to build the (artificial) bridge among arcs he needed to be able to now develop a story that had nothing to do with anything he had written before. (Of course, it’s not as if Gon’s sudden change of priorities couldn’t be possible, it’s just that, for narrative purposes, and from an audience standpoint, it was not believable). And it is precisely this lack of a believable or justifiable link between the motivations of the protagonists and the recently emerged biological threat which gives the audience few to no reasons to feel genuinely interested in it, much less when it had been already interested in another conflict/thread beforehand that hadn’t even been concluded yet. If there are no reasons why our protagonists should be caring about this biological anomaly, the new characters it introduces and their stories, then why the audience should?",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSome people argue that this isn’t really an issue because there was never a “main story” in Hunter x Hunter to begin with, that it was instead always just “Gon and friends exploring the world”; a collection of stories with different purposes and tones with the protagonists as the only constants, and that this arc was just one of the many different quests, a statement I fully disagree with. Hunter x Hunter was never about random adventuring. Here we had a clear, well-defined goal from the start. Moreover (and unlike some other battle shounens), the protagonist was actually and actively doing actions for the achievement of that goal since day 1. It was this goal the common thread that was unifying all the previous arcs. How can it be said then that there was never any overarching story? There was a clear direction here, and the Chimera Ants arc opted to deviate from it. Others say that Gon didn’t dismiss his search for dad, and just decided to follow Kite because he was well-respected by him. This could be true, but we as an audience, we expected him to continue with what he had been doing so far because we were invested in THAT struggle, yet the show, in the form of Gon’s decision, asked us to now be invested in something else and to forget for a (not precisely short) moment of the main reasons we were following the show. The whole arc then for these reasons felt ultimately like a gigantic filler arc, except that it wasn’t! It’s quite funny and curious to notice how the arc that was sold as the “main dish” or the “main attraction” of the series, and the one the fanbase favorites the most, actually was the one with the least amount of relevance and that least had to do with its premise! ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nBut what was really wrong with this? Why is it really bothering? Not only because of the continuity break and sudden focus-change I mentioned earlier, but in reality because the “DNA” of the show is suddenly artificially mutated into something else here. In concrete terms, with the forced inclusion of this arc, Hunter x Hunter is transformed (at least the way I see it) into what it never really was: a straight battle shounen about fighters and fights. Gon and Killua are now these full-time, “badass” super-warriors with cool superpowers that feel the duty to stop evil creatures from doing damage to the world, and Hunter x Hunter, once a series about a boy in his quest to find his dad, is now a series about fighting powerful enemies and saving the Earth. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nLike…seriously. Is this the reason why the audience signs up for in the beginning of the show when it knows nothing about it? Does the audience expect to watch another Dragon Ball Z with large-scale battles, powerful enemies that threaten the world and warriors who confront them when it’s watching the first arcs, when it was all about fairly normal people living adventures and trying to accomplish simple, mundane goals? I don’t think so. The C.A. arc makes Hunter x Hunter feel like a completely different series from what it had been and it is both disappointing and unsettling to notice. And while it’s true that the show had featured some (scattered) fights earlier, the show wasn’t really about them, they were never the focus, and all of them were still “down-to-earth” (this is: no “over 9000” stuff) and were actually linked to the motivations and purposes of the main cast; they represented real obstacles the protagonists had to face in order to meet their goals and/or to move to the next stage. And that can’t be said about the nature of the fights in C.A. arc. Hunter x Hunter was not a show about fighting and defeating powerful enemies that appear in the way. It never suggested to be so, despite having a power system, because Gon and Killua were never the cool shounen super-warriors owning powerful enemies after training and getting stronger. Yes, they were special, quicker and stronger than average people, but just that, they were still two normal boys the audience could always relate to since they were never depicted as shounen heroes who were going to take down the enemy in turn with world-domination or destruction purposes, but rather as people that could have been your simple, next door friends. Unfortunately, that sweet sense of relatability was totally lost here, where they were both turned into unrecognizable super-warriors having their badass “super saiyan” shounen moments (I know technically they aren’t that, but it’s still how they feel) and the down-to-earth feel of the series was lost too. It was quite a shame and a displeasure to see how a series that had given the impression of being just about fairly normal boys going in adventures, uncovering mysteries, facing and overcoming challenges in their quest to achieve clear personal goals, betrayed its audience when it suddenly replaced its adventurous nature by a straight battle shounen setting, feel and structure, despite having promised something else in the beginning.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nYou’d be thinking after reading all this that I have nothing good to say about the C.A. arc, but that’s not the case. It can’t be denied that the arc has the most ambitious writing of all, is morally complex and features thought-provoking ideas by exploring well the themes of the relationship between human beings, animals and their coexistence, the man vs the beast, the food chain and what does it mean to be a “perfect being” that will rule every species, among others. Also that it features a well-written main antagonist and that it shows interesting character development for both sides (though, it’s a shame how we finally got some great development for Gon during a conflict that had a filler-feel attached to it), all of these elements that certainly add value in a story. However, in line with the aforementioned continuity issue, the only way all of these elements can materialize their value is if they belong to something that feels to the audience relevant to begin with and/or contribute in a significant way to the main story of the series, which isn’t the case here when remembering there was never a natural transition to the arc, so they become -as harsh as it sounds- useless. No matter how dark and deep it wants to be, if it is something unrelated to the core of the series, there’s little reason the audience should care about all those themes. It’s hard to do it when the arc is structurally flawed since it doesn’t fit or can’t be connected in an organic way with all the previous ones. Besides, it doesn’t help that all of these themes have actually more relation to the character of Meruem instead of Gon. In fact, it can be seriously said that the main character of this arc is in reality Meruem than Gon. Why should then said themes matter much when they have little relation to the motivations of the main cast of the series? Themes alone are not enough to carry a narrative if the events surrounding them have little relation to it. ",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIn the end, what I’m trying to say here is that it’s not that the arc is bad on itself, it’s that it reduces the overall value of the whole show when joined with what had been developed before, because it makes it not work in the long run. (It’s the complete opposite to a synergy; making a mathematical analogy here, let’s call the value of the first 75 episodes (A) as V(A) and the value of the chimera ants arc (B) as V(B), what we have here is that the value of the combination, V(A+B), is less than the value of the sum of the parts: V(A+B) < V(A) + V(B)). Despite some issues, the C.A. arc is an interesting arc, but only when thinking of it as a separated, stand-alone entity from the earlier parts of the series. I can’t help but thinking that it would have been much better had it been part of another series where it could have fit more.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSpeaking about issues, the arc isn’t exactly free of some of them that, while not (that) severe, they certainly don’t help its cause and make it hard to consider a perfect one like the fanbase claims. For the sake of not making this review longer than what it already is, I’ll just list some of them, without going into much detail (and no, the slow pacing and the narrator aren’t part of them).",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\n•\tIt made 50% of the main cast be nowhere to be found for 50% of the whole show (it’s curious how other shounens are criticized for leaving relevant characters behind, yet Hunter x Hunter for some reason is excused for doing the same!), which is not something irrelevant narratively speaking. Kurapika and Leorio deserved better.",
            "\r\n•\tSome of the “ants” had plain ludicrous, laughable aspects, which made it difficult to take the arc as seriously as it wanted to be taken.",
            "\r\n•\tThe Gyro episode was totally useless, since he never becomes a relevant character later on, as well as those dedicated to showcase an uninteresting fight between some minor ants and some Phantom Troupe members, who were by force crammed in the story just so it could be said “hey, see? We haven’t forgotten about them!”.",
            "\r\n•\tWhy would the Hunter Association let two inexperienced kids help them to get rid of the ants instead of asking more experienced hunters do the risky, difficult job? ",
            "\r\n•\tHow did the ant queen get there and why is she larger than the “normal” chimera ants shown in the first episode by the lake? There is little explanation as to how these creatures came to be, which would have been appreciated.",
            "\r\n•\tAlso how the ants were able to retain part of the memories of the human beings from which they were created was too unrealistic. What’s inherited were genes, and memories have nothing to do with them. ",
            "\r\n•\tThe character of Komugi is presented as a plot device to show development for Meruem. She wasn’t ever really important.",
            "\r\n•\tPart of Gon’s development is rather acting out-of-character when he threatened to murder an innocent blind girl he knew had nothing to do with Pitou. ",
            "\r\n•\tSome highly dramatic and serious moments were partially ruined with bad comedy in the form of Pouf’s eccentric, effeminate behavior, in particular during the king’s recovery process. That was... just bad.",
            "\r\n•\tI really don’t have a problem with this, but I do have a problem when I see how other shounens are criticized for the inclusion of the so-called “power of friendship”, but Hunter x Hunter is curiously not when it does exactly the same thing when we see how Killua could remove the needle his brother implanted in his head thanks to…remembering his friendship with Gon. So no, it’s not like Hunter x Hunter completely avoids any type of emotion-based solution. ",
            "\r\n•\tSome people contend that Gon having an anger burst for Kite leading to his transformation was questionable since they hadn’t spent that much time together to develop enough feelings for him. I don’t agree with this, since Kite had always been an important figure to him, but I do agree that it would have certainly been much better and impactful had the murdered figure been someone more important to him like Killua or even Ging (had the case been he met him after G.I. arc).",
            "\r\n•\tFinally, and the one I consider the worst one, Kite “reviving” into a little girl was plain dumb, and this only served to drastically diminish the emotional impact of Gon’s said transformation scene shown only 5 episodes earlier. Now it turns out that Gon had lost his shit for someone that hadn’t ever really died! (at least, not his soul). Narratively speaking is anti-climactic.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nMoving to the last arc of the show, where the Hunter Association has to discuss how to elect its new chairman, Killua once again has to solve some family issues and Gon is magically recovered by a more sophisticated version of the dragon balls (literally), Chairman Election arc is a very disappointing way to conclude the series because not only it deals with the consequences of the Chimera Ants arc; it also suffers from them. Its most obvious unfortunate result is that yes, Gon finally meets his goal of finding dad, but not thanks to his own efforts, but rather thanks to fortune; Ging would not have gone to the celebration of the election at the Association had Netero not died and Netero would not have died if the ants had not shown up. In other words, because of the Chimera Ants arc, the show misses the opportunity of a more intriguing goal-resolution and a well-earned final prize for Gon. He finds him thanks to circumstances that didn’t depend on him. Why announcing the quest of finding Ging as a puzzle if at the end the puzzle never had to be solved? What was the point then? Moreover, it doesn’t help that the way the long-awaited first meeting occurs is not as inspiring as it should have been, considering it was the reason of the audience's investment in the show and all of Gon’s hard work. The crucial moment, instead of being treated dramatically and seriously, is treated very lightly with unfitting comedy, funny faces and funny music for no reason, like it hadn’t ever been serious business. Pretty underwhelming way to show the most important moment of the whole series.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nI can’t see Hunter x Hunter (2011) as a fully satisfying show, much less the peak of shounen anime. Not when it fails to deliver what it had promised in the beginning and suffers from severe continuity problems both in vibe (starting in Greed Island arc) and later also in focus (in Chimera Ants arc), that turn it ultimately into a troubled, deformed show where the audience doesn’t know what it’s watching anymore and feels confused regarding what it wants to be or do. I can’t help but thinking it would have been much better had it stuck to what it set out to do from the start and had it kept its initial focus instead of straying from it (with not even a natural, believable transition) with the inclusion of the Chimera Ants arc that made it not work in the long run. Why couldn’t it just follow the path it had clearly established, with a story related to the objectives of any member of the main cast? What was really the need to depart from it? If the answer is adding more maturity, thought-provoking ideas and showing more development to Gon and Killua, there were better ways to do so with a continuation actually linked to the premise, with for example a more complex next stage in their mission to find Ging that would have been much more interesting and rewarding, instead of massively shifting the attention into a story that for the protagonists' purposes was just a side-quest with fillerish-feel and little relation to the driver of the narrative.",

            "\r\nAs someone who found very good and enjoyed the earlier parts of the series (especially in its first 1999 adaptation), was deeply immersed in its story, characters and world and was obviously very interested to know how it would keep unfolding and end, I badly wanted to like Hunter x Hunter (2011) and join this party, but unfortunately that couldn’t be the case for all the reasons I’ve explained. It’s not a straight bad series at all, but -despite understanding the reasons why it enjoys such a good reputation among the fans- it also isn’t something I would easily recommend to anyone, nor call the “best action shounen of all”, a distinction I’d contend either version of the Fullmetal Alchemist series enjoys (and this even when neither of them is my all-time personal favorite), which, unlike Hunter x Hunter (2011), are both of them fully well-functioning and satisfying in their own ways. 6/10."

            "\r\nLike I said before the start of the show was quite nice. It had a few things which didn’t really make any sense, especially the riddles, but it had a nice build up and a good pacing. It seemed to me as if the start also really wanted to surprise the viewers with something unexpected, regardless of how illogical it was. It also didn’t do much good in terms of atmosphere, in some cases it even destroys the atmosphere it built up just for surprise reasons. The main characters are also unexplained overpowered, sure there are a few stronger but that alone doesn’t justify a little kid being physically stronger than a well-trained grown up man, just because he “grew up in the woods”, which is btw contradicted later on. But besides a few negative things to say, the start (first 17-20 episodes maybe) was ok. It had a goal and set motivation from the character side, the main story kinda made sense (more than the rest of the show) and they had some kind of, what the fans claim as “tactics in fighting”.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIn the second arc the terror already begins. Motivations from the character were completely forgotten and not even mentioned in order to have a little conflict for the goal of this arc. The reason for the first arc and what they have achieved was completely pointless and even contradictory as explained in the later arcs. The following arcs shine with, not knowing what to call somethings. For the show an assassin is someone who is physically strong and can endure much pain instead of being stealthy and deadly, the so called “mafia” is a bunch of unorganized idiots who apparently have a lot of power (they at least have a lot of money) which is contradictory in every way and let me question the whole world building of this anime and we still don't know what a Hunter is and does. The writers have no idea of how money works, which wouldn’t be a problem if they hadn’t dedicated a whole arc just for money getting purposes, which later on is also completely useless. Not to forget the story is full of convenience, which goes beyond the acceptable amount.  Some of the arcs are complete filler since they either are pointless or have nothing to do with the final goal (the motivation of the main protagonist). There is even one arc were the main protagonist is inside a video game and literally the first thing he hears there is that being here is completely pointless, but he doesn’t care and goes on anyway, which makes the whole arc pointless and questions the existence of the build up to it. ",

It’s like comparing a pile of shit with a pile of shit which has a cherry on top of it.

It even shifts during the whole anime, making character who should be strong considering their rank utterly weak and character who should be weak unnecessary strong. Its like as if one writer wrote the hierarchy of all the characters and their relationship and then another decided, because how much he liked their appearance how strong they are. ",

You can’t take anything they say and do seriously, since the character design is so freaking retarded. They say they are ants but then a penguin and a pink panda in a suit is sitting there with them. The writers wanted to make this arc dark and mature but only present it in such a childish way.",

Where villains came from and what their motivation is was never a thing HunterXHunter spends any time in but in this case it makes absolutely no sense that some ant-people who just came into existence are able to be as strong as one of the strongest person in the whole anime. So again.. no scale existend. And with no time spend with motivation and personification the writers now believe they can put drama in the show when the villains die. Are you freaking kidding me? Yeah the ants just killed hundreds if not thousands of people and now I should feel sorry for them? The drama in this whole anime is the worst sort of melodrama, forced and reliable so much on double standarts. ",

In the last 50 episodes there is only a handful of fights anyways, so there is not much to talk about, but the tactics there is so utterly idiotic. There is so much bullshit that happened during this arc, there was not 1 episode where I wasn’t facepalming. ",
            "\r\nBut all of the above would have been minor points if it wasn’t for how boring this whole arc was. The reason I criticize their “tactics” is only because they spend so much time with talking and every fan thinks the tactics are so great. 90% of the time they talk about irrelevant stuff and when it comes to real tactics they are utterly bullshit, convenient or deus ex machina.",

Add a bunch of extra typical side characters and you got them all. It’s just the typical teenager character who is strong enough to change the world stuff.  In HunterXHunter they at least  didnt go full overpowered with the main character, but considering the age of the protagonist and the enemies he  is fighting later on I would say its pretty unrealistic (also there are some moments later on were our MC goes into deus ex machina overpowered mode for some reason). He is a very wish-fulfilling character and not that much of a role model (so instead of giving him realistic trades he is super positive all the time and strong etc.). I think there is nothing really wrong with this wish-fulfilling kind of anime, but they just feel very childish.  So saying this is more than a shounen is really wrong. ",

Artstyle is simple and character design in the WHOLE show is the worst I have ever seen, but that’s ofc only my opinion. I found it to be nice to see no cgi, if I remember correctly. ",

I was going for Fast & Furious 9, but he said ‘that is a stupid movie of a franchise that overstayed its welcome’. Unlike this smart movie which is not part of a franchise that overstayed its welcome.

So I watched the movie and I hated it and I wasn’t planning to make an overview about it, but then I found a Reddit topic where someone insisted that if Gintama isn’t in your top 10 it means you either didn’t watch it or you dropped it early on. Especially if you watched a lot of anime. It triggered me enough to write this text. Thus it’s not my fault, it’s his fault.",

And then anime references appear that have nothing to do with the plot, ruin the seriousness, point out the lack of creativity Gintama has, and how it would never be popular if it wasn’t taking advantage of other popular titles. I know what you’re about to say. But Snob, Gintama was always doing that so it makes sense to keep doing that, if you don’t like it. Such a bold claim from the fans who agree that they didn’t like Gintama until they watched 150 episodes. No show that demands from you to watch 150 episodes before you start liking anime references can be considered great.",

It had a ton of flashbacks to stuff that you already know from the series, and even if you don’t know because you didn’t watch the show, the flashbacks were so many, so long, and interrupted the plot so often to the point you didn’t give a shit. My friend who is a diehard fan of Gintama, was playing a Dragonball gatcha game during the flashbacks because he got bored of them.",

Well I watched it the next day and what did you know, it was the exact same thing in terms of action. Dozens of bad guys shooting, multiple explosions and crashes and beatings, and none of the good guys ever got hurt. It was impossible to take it seriously. And I know that many of you are going to say, I didn’t watch enough episodes to get used to the action being like that. The fights were always that improbable and if you had watched 500 episodes, you would like them. No, I wouldn’t. I would hate them every single time, because they can’t be taken seriously despite the show desperately trying to come off as serious in those scenes.",

This thing happened in the middle of a serious battle. My diehard Gintama friend was eyerolling. The final duel has the bad guy slashing and punching Gintoki a hundred times. He lost 10 gallons of blood and every bone in his body broke. 10 seconds later he was perfectly fine. What kind of a final battle is this? The same shit was happening all the time in Mortadello and Filemon, another movie I watched weeks ago and it was brilliant there, because it never tried to take itself seriously. There was never any tonal whiplash, since it always had the same comedic tone. Gintama is the definition of tonal whiplash and anyone who insists it’s amazing for instantly switching from tragedy to comedy is an idiot.",

Something-something mind control, something-something multiple personalities, something-something I regret being a bad guy who wanted to kill everyone so let me magically fix everything and you can all forgive me. What a load of bullshit. Gintama should have stayed as nothing more than a plotless rip off of popular shonen instead of trying to have a dramatic plot. Everyone will tell you the same, diehard fans included.",

            "\r\nAnd then it gets worse. The movie goes on to show the aftermath of the story and how every character got his closure. Or better say, didn’t. Because it’s basically the same joke a dozen times. They tell you this character changed completely later on, only to be proven it was a troll and absolutely nothing changed. 500 episodes, a dozen movies and a gazzilion adventures later we got zero plot progression, zero character development and zero story closure. Everything ended exactly as it began. Where’s this amazing story all the fanboys kept talking about? ‘Gintama is not just references and toilet humor, it also has an amazing plot’. How is that possible when nothing changed in the entirety of the series?",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nAnd it doesn’t even stop there; the end credit scene shows the mangaka self inserting as a gorilla and telling the audience that he didn’t want to give closure to anyone so the fans can speculate anything they want about them. What a genius. Why bother thinking of an ending when the fans are going to make one for you? Less effort, more praise. And that was the end of Gintama. A movie I see nobody’s talking about, regarding a series that nobody cares about for a long time now."

The season dives straight into its main focus which is comedy and gives us all sorts of parodies and laughs that viewers can relate to other shows, which is what makes it so great.

            "\r\n",
            "\r\nIf there’s one thing I didn’t like about how the season went is the skipping of some of the smaller arcs. Gintama has always been faithful at adapting all its arcs, but this season was quite different. This may be due to pushing it for OVAs to sell, or maybe they just didn’t have the time slots available. That or something came up within the studio to make them adapt the bigger arcs earlier.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nWith that, I guess we should talk about the highly anticipated arcs that a lot of people have been waiting for since the announcement of the season. Without trying to spoil, these arcs provide a lot to the watchers as to what’s happening to some of the most known groups/people in the Gintama franchise.  The first arc is the Shogun arc which obviously focuses on the Shogun himself but also his enemies. Compared to the other big arcs, I’d say this was a pretty good arc and rivaled some of the other ones from the past seasons. If you thought that was all for the big arcs, then think again! Not only do we get one major roller coaster arc this season, but two. The other being the Shinsengumi arc which focuses on the Police force of Edo and two other “prominent” groups—the Joui rebels and the Mimawarigumi. Unlike the previous arc, this arc is more about emotion than it is about action. While this arc does have action, I wouldn’t put it ahead of the arc before it in that sense. I still enjoyed this arc though because it shows us some backstory of some of the Shinsengumi, the Mimawarigumi, and even Gintoki. These two arcs go hand-in-hand as the former leads into the latter. Just what is in store for our beloved characters?",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nVisually speaking, it has been up and down here and there. Mostly a hit though. Like most shows, or at least ones that want to stand out in scenes, the visuals will go above and beyond then the usual to look when it needs to. The comedy arcs were also pretty good in terms of its animation, but there were times when the animation took a turn down and looked pretty bad.

I remember starting it right before summer vacation and just binging the hell out of it, laughing at the hilarious moments and being kinda touched by some of the serious stuff too. It became something very special for me and it was just constantly getting better and better the further I got into it. When I finished the first 201 episodes of Gintama I was so excited to start season 2 or Gintama' right afterwards. I was about a quarter way into it and\n                  ",

I mean, I did enjoy it but at the same time I didn't. None of the \"serious\" arcs didn't really hit me as much as they did in season 1 nor did the comedy. After that I just continued to watch and at some points were kinda forcing myself through some of it, I kept making up excuses in my head as to why I wasn't enjoying it and now I've realized that I was just lying to myself.

There are so many better shows out there that I would rank higher than this but MAL's rating system pretty shit to begin with though so maybe that's not too surprising. ",

Every single arc after episode 201 feels so short and underdeveloped in my opinion. Arcs felt like they had so much more built up to them before, they really benefited from that, or maybe it's just me who got tired of the Gintama formula, I don't know tbh.  ",

",
            "\r\nWhile I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nSpeaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. ",
            "\r\nFurthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nMoreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters.",

When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. ",

Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose.",

All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. ",

            "\r\nBesides, for a show that relies so strongly on the \"emotions of the sacrifices made in war\" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource.  ",

I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. ",

She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity.",

I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose.",

But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode.",

You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable.",
            "\r\n",
            "\r\nWhile the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of \"Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into."

Unfortunately, however, most of the characters did not arouse my interest, the Elric brothers left me indifferent for most of the time, I did not find them interesting or innovative, the same goes for most of the cast, I liked Mustang during the last episodes, I loved Izumi and then there are Greed and Envy, who are the only thing in the whole anime that really captured my attention, they are well-made characters, not banal and have that extra complexity that I look for, their scenes (and the last 10 episodes) are among the few elements that did not bore me and genuinely piqued my interest.",

The problem is that it's just so basic: a simplistic hero's journey with unambiguously evil villains and a fairly juvenile atmosphere throughout, despite the show usually taking itself very seriously. The writers were apparently scared of showing too much death in quick succession too frequently, so the heroes almost always refuse to kill the bad guys, and they neutralize henchmen by bonking them on the head and knocking them unconscious like it's a\n                  ",

            "\r\nThe show tries for comedy quite frequently, but the jokes rarely landed for me. Perhaps that's due to it having very few arrows in its quiver in this regard. It usually just involves characters overreacting in some goofy way. There's the \"mistaking alphonse for the FMA\" gag, the \"Ed getting embarrassed about Winry\" gag, the random shirtless scenes with Armstrong, and, of course, the many, *many* times that characters call Ed short. I don't think I've ever heard another series use the term \"pipsqueak\" as often as this one does. ",

First, there's the show's inherent reluctance to show death, with characters getting stabbed with what should be grave wounds but end up just being moderately injured, or even shrugging it off entirely. Second, there's the classic anime mystery genre problem of characters simply manifesting new powers that resolve the situation whenever they're in danger, which rapidly conditions me to expect this kind of resolution whenever the good guys are in trouble. Third, the villains never seemed particularly committed to thwarting Ed and friends. They attack piecemeal and with little sustained intensity. I had thought this would be due to a later reveal that the bad guys had been purposely letting Ed disrupt their schemes, that it was \"all part of the plan\" especially given the scenes where Father is implied to be watching over everything, but this wasn't the case. Instead, it's revealed early on that Ed is needed as a \"sacrifice\" which effectively means he's immune from any major harm since the bad guys can't kill him, they can only harass his friends as an indirect punishment.
